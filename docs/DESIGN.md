# BICII Admin — Design tokens and primitives

Staff-facing tasks on these screens: [USER-GUIDE.md](USER-GUIDE.md).

The Admin has to look like it belongs to BICII. Its tokens start from the
public site's `src/app/globals.css` (palette, dust ramp, Archivo + Inter,
spring easings, two-tone focus ring, `.gutter` / `.eyebrow` / `.measure`)
and add an operational layer the public site does not need. Everything lives
in [`src/app/globals.css`](../src/app/globals.css) as Tailwind 4 `@theme`
tokens, so each one is also a utility class (`bg-waiting`, `text-dense`,
`min-h-tap`).

To see them: `npm run dev`, open `/dev/ui` (development only; it 404s in
production builds).

## Brand layer (ported verbatim)

| Token | Value | Use |
|---|---|---|
| `ink` | `#050707` | Text, borders, solid buttons |
| `paper` | `#fbfaf7` | Page background, `themeColor` |
| `red` `yellow` `sky` `indigo` `green` | wordmark accents | Fills only, except indigo (10.37:1 on paper) |
| `dust-100…700` | warm neutral ramp | `dust-500` = secondary text (4.95:1 paper, 4.54:1 dust-100); `dust-300` only on ink |
| `font-display` / `font-sans` | Archivo / Inter (next/font, variable) | Uppercase Archivo for labels and buttons |
| `ease-spring` `ease-soft` `ease-pop` `ease-glide` | spring curves | Press-compress, sheets, toasts |

## Operational layer (Admin only)

**Surfaces**, back to front: `paper` (page) → `sunken` (= dust-100: wells,
table headers) → `card` (white, with a `hairline` = dust-200 border).

**Status** maps onto the five accents. Each status has four tokens:

| Status | Accent | Solid fill + text | Ratio | Soft fill + text | Ratio |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `waiting` | yellow | `bg-waiting text-waiting-fg` (ink) | 12.16:1 | `bg-waiting-soft text-waiting-deep` | 5.62:1 |
| `progress` | sky | `bg-progress text-progress-fg` (ink) | 8.00:1 | `bg-progress-soft text-progress-deep` | 5.77:1 |
| `done` | green | `bg-done text-done-fg` (ink) | 6.42:1 | `bg-done-soft text-done-deep` | 5.38:1 |
| `danger` | red | `bg-danger text-danger-fg` (paper) | 4.71:1 | `bg-danger-soft text-danger-deep` | 5.67:1 |
| `info` | indigo | `bg-info text-info-fg` (paper) | 10.37:1 | `bg-info-soft text-info-deep` | 8.53:1 |

Never put ink text on red (4.11:1). The `-deep` steps also pass as text on
paper (6.1–6.8:1), so `text-danger-deep` is the error-message colour. Domain
code maps its enums onto these five (e.g. `waiting_parts` → waiting,
`ready` → done, overdue → danger) and always shows the text label with the
colour.

**Density**: `text-dense` is 13px on a 20px line, for tables and line items;
pair money and quantity columns with `tabular-nums`. Inputs stay at 16px so
iOS does not zoom on focus.

**Tap targets**: `--spacing-tap` is 44px (`min-h-tap`, `size-tap`). Every
interactive primitive meets it; buttons are 48px by default as on the public
site.

All ratios come from `npm run tokens:contrast` (`scripts/contrast.mjs`), which
fails if a documented text pair drops under 4.5:1 or a UI pair under 3:1.
Change a colour → rerun → update the comments in `globals.css` and this table.

## Primitives (`src/components/ui/`)

Server components unless they need state or browser APIs.

| Component | Notes |
|---|---|
| `Button`, `ButtonLink`, `SubmitButton` | solid / outline / accent / ghost / danger; sm / md / lg; `pending` sets aria-busy, disables, shows a spinner; press-compress. Labels never wrap unless `wrap` is set (a long label in a phone-width footer or card, e.g. with `w-full sm:w-auto`), so a long label never widens the page. `SubmitButton` (client) reads `useFormStatus`. |
| `IconButton` | `aria-label` is required by type. |
| `Field` (client) | Label, hint, error, required marker. Provides context so the control inside gets `id`, `aria-describedby` (error, hint), `aria-invalid`, `required`. |
| `Input`, `Textarea`, `NumberInput` (client) | `NumberInput` is `type="text"` + `inputMode` (decimal for money, numeric for a whole-number quantity); values stay strings — parse with `lib/money`. Optional −/+ steppers. A quantity with `decimals` (job lines and intake services take 2, for 1.5 hours of labour) gets the decimal keypad, and its steppers add or take 1 in decimal arithmetic, keeping the fraction. |
| `Checkbox`, `Switch` (client) | Checkbox is native and styled; Switch is `role="switch"` for settings that apply immediately. |
| `Sheet` (client) | Modal dialog: bottom sheet on phones, right panel at `md`+. Inerts the rest of the page, traps Tab, Escape closes, focus returns to the opener. `dismissible={false}` while a commit is pending. Without a footer the body pads for the iPhone home indicator. While open it moves toasts above its footer (`--toast-inset-bottom`). |
| `ToastProvider`, `useToast` (client) | Polite live region for confirmations, `role="alert"` for errors (errors persist until dismissed). Mounted in the root layout. On phones it sits above the tab bar (never over Scan); an open Sheet lifts it above its Save/Cancel row. Optional `action` (`{ label, onAction }`, e.g. "Retry" on a failed upload) adds one button that runs it and dismisses the toast; toasts with an action stay until dismissed and are never pushed out (at most four show; a new toast pushes out the oldest plain one). Optional `key`: a toast with the same key replaces the one on screen in place (one "3 photos not saved" per record, not one per photo); `dismiss` takes the id or the key. The provider outlives navigation, so a Retry still works after the screen that failed was left. |
| `Badge`, `StatusPill` | Tone = the status tokens; pills always carry text. |
| `Card`, `EmptyState`, `Skeleton`, `Spinner`, `PageHeader` | Layout and feedback. `Card` never clips (no `overflow-hidden`), so pickers, menus and focus rings inside it can extend past its edge; flush content rounds its own corners. Its header wraps: an action too wide to sit beside the title (a half-width card on iPad) moves under it rather than squeezing it, and several actions wrap among themselves (a job's Add service, Add part, Add manual line on a phone). |
| `RowList`, `RowLink` | Edge-to-edge list of tappable rows (More, Settings, Staff; later jobs, products, customers). Rows use the inset focus ring and round their own first/last corners; the list does not clip. |
| `SearchPicker` (client) | ARIA 1.2 combobox + listbox; async `search(query)` (may be a Server Action), debounce, stale-response guard, ↑/↓/Enter/Escape, hidden input for forms. `action` adds a last option ("Create new customer") reached with the arrows and Enter like any result. Optional pickers (`clearable`, default `!required`) can go back to nothing: a 44px clear button, emptying the field and leaving it, or Escape on an empty field; `onSelect(null)` reports it. Inside a `Sheet` (`InSheetBodyContext`, `src/components/ui/sheet-context.ts`) the results take space in the flow and are scrolled into view, because the sheet body clips an absolute popup behind its footer when the sheet is short (Add part on a phone); elsewhere they float under the input. SPEC §22: use it instead of any large `<select>`. |
| `Chip`, `ChipRadioGroup` (client) | A 48px choice chip: a toggle button (`aria-pressed`) for several choices. `ChipRadioGroup` for one choice (the intake's lead, Assign's who, the board's mechanic filter): a radio group with one Tab stop (the chosen chip, or the first) and Arrow / Home / End moving and choosing, like `SegmentedControl`. |
| `Select` (client) | A native select styled like `Input`, wired by `Field`. Only for short fixed lists (fewer than 15 options: a service's category); anything that grows uses `SearchPicker`. |
| `SegmentedControl`, `Tabs` (client) | Radiogroup and tablist with roving tabindex and arrow keys. A segment can be `disabled` (`aria-disabled`, skipped by the arrow keys, ignores clicks, muted text and a not-allowed cursor); say why next to the control (photo visibility: never public on a customer record, or for an undecoded original). Each state has its own class branch: `cn()` does not resolve conflicting utilities. `value={null}` is a choice with no default (the charge bearer, D4): nothing is checked, the hidden input is empty and the first enabled segment takes the Tab stop. |

Class strings are joined with `cn()` (`src/lib/cn.ts`), which does not merge
conflicting utilities; prefer a variant prop over overriding colours with
`className`.

## Focus

The global ring (`:focus-visible`: 3px indigo outline, 3px offset, paper
halo) is drawn outside the element. Anything full-bleed inside a clipping
or edge-to-edge container uses the **inset** variant, the `focus-inset`
utility (`globals.css`): the same two tones drawn inside the element, so no
ancestor's `overflow` can cut it. Used by `RowLink`, `Tabs` and
`SegmentedControl` (both scroll horizontally, which clips vertically too).
Never add `overflow-hidden` to a container of focusable rows to get rounded
corners; round the first and last rows instead.

## Forms

The pattern every Server Action form follows (`staffAction` +
`useActionState`, `src/lib/actions.ts`):

- React resets uncontrolled fields after every form action, success or
  not. A failed action returns `values` (the submitted text fields, never
  passwords or other secrets, `src/lib/form-data.ts`); render them back as
  `defaultValue={values?.field ?? ""}` so nothing typed is lost. Passwords
  are re-entered.
- Errors: `error` above the form (`role="alert"`), `fieldErrors` on each
  `Field`. `useFocusFirstInvalid(state)` (ref on the `<form>`) moves focus to
  the first invalid control after a failed submit.
- Controls that apply immediately (switches) use the action directly with
  `useOptimistic` and a toast, not a form.
- Create/edit forms live in a `Sheet` whose body is mounted only while it
  is open (`CustomerSheet`, `BikeSheet`), so every opening starts clean.
  The submit button sits in the sheet footer, outside the `<form>`, and
  points at it with `form={formId}`; it takes `pending` from
  `useActionState`. The action wrapper passed to `useActionState` handles
  success (toast, close or `router.push` to the new record).
- A form that creates a record carries its own id (`newId()`,
  `src/lib/uuid.ts`, made when the sheet opens) as the idempotency key: a
  repeated submit finds the row it already created (the domain treats the
  primary-key conflict as success) instead of making a second customer or
  bike. `newId()` falls back from `crypto.randomUUID()` (secure contexts
  only) to `getRandomValues()` for an iPad on a plain-http LAN address.
- A form that appends a permanent record (a timeline note, a Cult Commons
  rate) carries a `newId()` key the same way, and the RPC replays on it, so
  a retry after a lost response never writes the record twice.
- An edit sheet over text other people also edit (a job's details) sends
  only the fields its user changed; the RPC keeps the rest (null keeps), so
  a colleague's newer text is not overwritten with this page's older copy.
- One-tap buttons that stay in place while what they do changes (a job's
  status buttons, whose first slot is the next step) are disabled for
  400 ms after each change (`useArmedAfter` in `src/components/ui/use-armed.ts`),
  so the second tap of a double tap cannot take the button the first one
  revealed. A final step (marking a job collected) is never one tap.
- Destructive or commit steps (deactivate staff; later stock, payment and
  settlement reversals) are two steps: the first button opens a confirm
  block that asks for the reason (SPEC §22), puts focus in the reason field,
  places the confirm button in a different position with a different React
  `key` (so the first button's DOM node and focus are not reused), and
  ignores clicks for 400 ms after opening (a double tap). See
  `AccessControl` in `settings/staff/[staffId]/staff-controls.tsx`, and
  "Delete photo" in the photo viewer.
- A confirmation without a reason field (archive a customer or bike,
  `ArchiveControl`) puts focus on Cancel and keeps its confirm button
  *disabled* for 400 ms rather than silently ignoring an early press, so
  a double tap cannot confirm and nothing seems to swallow a click.
  Archiving is reversible (Unarchive is one press) and deletes nothing.

## Loading

- Sections whose pages need nothing beyond `requireStaff()` have a
  `loading.tsx` rendering `RouteLoading` (skeletons in an `aria-busy`
  region): it is prefetched, so a tap shows the new screen's skeleton at
  once.
- A loading boundary makes the response stream, which commits it to HTTP
  200 before the page runs (Next docs, `loading.js` "Status Codes"): a page
  under it that calls `forbidden()` or `notFound()` shows the right UI with
  a 200. So permission-gated subtrees (`/settings/staff`, `/reports`) have
  none, nor do the group root (`/`) and `/settings` (whose subtree includes
  `/settings/staff`), keeping their real 403s. `/reports` has no
  `loading.tsx` anywhere: `/reports/lines` answers a real 403 without View
  financial reports, and `/reports` streams each section in its own
  `<Suspense>` after `requireStaff()` instead ([Reports](#reports)).
- Every nav link (tab bar, rail) marks its icon while its navigation is
  pending (`LinkPending`, `useLinkStatus`), which also covers the sections
  without a `loading.tsx`.
- `/q/[shortId]` has no `loading.tsx` on purpose: its job is a server
  `redirect()`, which must happen before anything streams.
- `/settings/schedule` and `/settings/appointment-types` need only
  `requireStaff()` (every staff member reads the schedule; only admins
  see edit controls, never a 403), so each has its own `loading.tsx`
  like `/settings/profile`; `/settings` itself still has none.
- Record pages (`/customers/[id]`, `/bikes/[id]`) have their own
  `loading.tsx`, so opening a row shows the record skeleton at once. An
  unknown or malformed id renders the not-found screen (with a 200 status,
  as above).
- Search-as-you-type changes only `?q=`: the page segment keeps its React
  state (Next keys segments without search params), so the field keeps
  focus and caret, the old results stay until the new ones arrive (the
  navigation is a transition), and the field shows a spinner meanwhile.

## App shell (`src/components/shell/`)

| Piece | Notes |
|---|---|
| `TabBar` (client) | Phones (< md): fixed bottom bar, Today · Jobs · **Scan** · Inventory · More. Scan is a raised 64px yellow disc. Pads for `env(safe-area-inset-bottom)`; pages pad their bottom to clear it. |
| `SideRail` (client) | md and up: sticky labelled rail with the mark, the four primary sections (Scan in yellow) and every More destination. |
| `AppHeader` | Sticky; mark (phones only), `HeaderSearch`, and `ProfileChip` (initials → `/settings/profile`) streamed in `<Suspense>`. Clears `env(safe-area-inset-top)`. |
| `HeaderSearch` (client) | The global search field ("Search customers, bikes, jobs and stock"): a `next/form` GET form to `/search?q=` (works before hydration), remembered in recent searches on submit; a query that is exactly a short ID in any case ("p-000123") opens the record straight away through `/q/{id}` instead (`shortIdJump`, `src/lib/search.ts`; still remembered); `/` focuses it from anywhere on a keyboard. On `/search` it steps aside for the page's own field. |
| `nav.ts` | Single source for tabs, More items and active-state matching. |
| `ComingSoon` | `PageHeader` + `EmptyState` naming the phase that builds a section. |
| `StatusScreen` | 401/403/404/500 pages. |
| `ServiceWorkerRegistration` | Registers `public/sw.js` in production builds only. |

## Domain components (`src/components/domain/`)

Built from the primitives for one kind of record or job; Client Components
unless noted. They call Server Actions, never Supabase (except the photo
upload itself, below).

| Component | Notes |
|---|---|
| `SearchField` | Search box whose query lives in the URL (`?q=`, `src/lib/search-params.ts`): typing updates it after 300 ms with `router.replace` in a transition, Enter at once; other params (`archived`) are kept; back/forward and links update the field, but its own search arriving late never overwrites what was typed since (it remembers what it sent). A search still waiting for the pause is dropped when a link is clicked or the field unmounts, so it cannot pull staff back to the list. Pages render results on the server; lists say "First 30 matches" and how to narrow it when there are more. Used by `/customers`, `/bikes`, `/search`. |
| `ArchivedFilter` (server) | Active / Archived links for a list page, keeping `?q=`. The Archived list searches with `staff_search(…, archived => true)`, so a query matches exactly as on the active list. |
| `ShortId` (server) | A human short ID in monospace, never wrapped; `large` is the identity header of a record (the number on the bike's label). `ShortIdLink` links the chip with a 44px (`--spacing-tap`) hit area from a transparent `::before` overlay, so a standalone chip link (job part lines, stock movements) meets the tap floor without changing the row. |
| `CustomerSheet`, `NewCustomerButton`, `EditCustomerButton` | New/edit customer. Creating opens the new customer's page. |
| `BikeSheet`, `NewBikeButton`, `EditBikeButton` | New/edit bike. A new bike's owner is preset (from a customer's page), picked (`CustomerPicker`), or none (shop and consigned bikes). The edit form has no owner: ownership changes only by transfer. Creating opens the bike, ready for photos. |
| `TransferOwnershipButton` | Sheet: new owner (a customer via `CustomerPicker`, or the shop) and a required reason, kept in the bike's ownership history. The current owner is listed but not choosable. |
| `CustomerPicker` | `SearchPicker` over active customers (`staff_search`), via a Server Action. |
| `ArchiveControl` | Archive (confirmed) / unarchive a customer, bike, service, product (refused while public or holding stock) or consignor (refused with items for sale or a balance other than 0, D47; the toast carries the mapped refusal with D46's remedies), with what archiving does in a sentence. |
| `CaptureButton` | The camera control for every photo (intake reuses it): "Take photo" (`<input type=file accept="image/*" capture="environment">`, opens the rear camera on phones) and "Choose photos" (library, several at once). Each file is decoded with its EXIF orientation (`createImageBitmap(…, { imageOrientation: "from-image" })`, `<img>` fallback), scaled to at most 2048 px on the long edge and re-encoded as JPEG 0.85 (`prepare-photo.ts`, sizing in `src/lib/images.ts`); re-encoding also drops EXIF, GPS included. A file the browser cannot decode (HEIC outside Safari) is uploaded as is when it is an accepted photo type. Then: a signed upload URL from the server, upload with the browser Supabase client straight to Storage with byte progress, record. Optimistic thumbnails with status and progress; up to two photos in flight. The queue lives above the pages (`PhotoUploadsProvider` in the staff layout, `upload-store.ts`), so uploads finish after leaving the record and their tiles are there again on coming back. A failure keeps the photo and its preview on its tile (Retry, Discard); one error toast per record ("3 photos not saved", Retry all) updates in place and is never pushed out; the header shows "N photos not saved" on every screen, linking to the record; closing or reloading the tab while any photo is unsaved asks first. Retry resumes at the failed step: once the object is in Storage only recording is retried (unless the server says it is missing). Photos are labelled "New photo 3", not by file name (iPhone captures are all image.jpg). A file Storage refuses (type, size) is not retried and says to save it as JPEG. The page refreshes once when a record's queue drains, not once per photo (each refresh re-signs every photo). A photo picked before hydration is picked up when React attaches. An undecodable original keeps its metadata, so it is recorded without dimensions and can never be made public. |
| `PhotoGrid` | A record's photos: thumbnails (visibility badge when not internal) that open `PhotoViewer`, with `CaptureButton` under them (hidden for archived records). |
| `ReasonConfirm` | The two-step destructive pattern with a required reason (below, "Forms"), shared by voiding a line and cancelling or reopening a job: focus in the reason field, the confirm button in a new position with a new key, presses ignored for 400 ms, and a dismiss button that returns focus to the first button. The dismiss button says what it keeps where "Cancel" would be ambiguous: "Keep job" beside "Cancel job", "Keep line" beside "Void line", "Back" for a reopen. `onConfirmingChange` lets a sheet hide its own submit while the confirmation is open. The first button's label ends with "…"; `startAccessibleName` gives it a distinct name where a list has one per row ("Delete the Tue 13 Oct closure…"). |
| `LeadPicker` | The lead mechanic as `ChipRadioGroup` chips ("Me" first, Unassigned last), shared by the intake's People step and appointment check-in. |
| `IntakeWizard` | `/jobs/new` (SPEC §7.1): one step at a time with "Step 2 of 5" and a progress bar, Back/Next as 48px buttons kept above the tab bar, Enter advancing on a keyboard (not in a textarea, a picker or a sheet). Customer (one `SearchPicker` over customers and bikes; a bike selects its owner; "New customer" opens `CustomerSheet` with `onCreated`), Bike (the customer's active bikes as large cards with an "Open job J-…" chip; "Add bike" opens `BikeSheet` with the owner preset and `onCreated`), Work (requested work, condition on arrival), People (lead as single-select chips, "Me" first, Unassigned allowed; additional staff as toggles; active staff only, D22), Services (chips by category, a filter above 12, −/+ quantity, a preview subtotal and, only with view_costs, a Cult Commons preview), then Review with Edit per section. It owns the job's and each service line's `newId()` key, so a double tap or retry makes one job. Draft: `src/lib/intake-draft.ts`, one per device under `bicii.intake-draft.v1` (ids, labels, typed text; guarded like recent searches), offered back as "Continue the intake you started at 10:42?" / Discard, cleared on success; Continue drops services no longer offered and staff no longer active (they could not be seen or removed, and the job would be refused every time) and says what it removed. A bike whose owner is archived is "Owned by … (archived)", never a shop bike: choosing it says to unarchive the owner or transfer the bike. If the bikes cannot be loaded, an error with "Try again" replaces the skeleton. The progress bar has one segment per counted step, full at "Step 5 of 5". Rendered only in the browser (the draft is in localStorage). |
| `JobStatusActions` | The usual next steps (`primaryActions`) as large buttons with a toast, disabled for 400 ms after every status change (the next step's button lands under the finger). "Collected…" is final (D15), so it opens a confirmation naming the job and the customer, focus on Back, "Mark collected" disabled for 400 ms. "Change status": a sheet listing the other allowed moves (`allowedTransitions`) with nothing pre-selected, an optional note and, when Collected is picked, that it is final; plus Reopen and Cancel as `ReasonConfirm` (D15, D16), during which the sheet's own submit is hidden. Nothing for a collected or cancelled job. |
| `LineTable` | A job's lines, dense (`text-dense`, `tabular-nums`): description, qty, unit price, total, and with view_costs unit cost, yield and Cult Commons per line. Its layout follows its own width (container queries: 28rem without costs, 42rem with), not the screen's, since the lines card is narrow on an iPad; narrower, each line is a stacked row. Voided lines stay, struck through with who, when and why, behind "Show voided". Each live line of an open job has `VoidLineControl`. A manual line added without a cost shows a "Cost pending" badge to everyone (D14), and "—" as its unit cost. |
| `VoidLineControl` | "Void…" on a line: `ReasonConfirm` calling `voidLine`. |
| `AddServiceButton` / `AddServiceSheet` | `SearchPicker` over active services (price and category shown), quantity with steppers, the price prefilled and editable by anyone (D14), the cost field only with view_costs, a live line-total preview; the sheet's `newId()` line key makes a repeat submit add one line. Disabled with "Completed jobs are locked. Reopen to change lines." once the job is completed. |
| `ManualLineButton` / `ManualLineSheet` | Description, quantity, unit price and (view_costs only) cost, with the same preview, key and lock. Left without a cost, the line is marked cost pending (D14); the sheet says so (to view_costs holders: "Enter 0 when there is no direct cost"). |
| `TotalsSummary` (server) — the job yield panel | The compact summary row under the lines (SPEC §22, not a modal): the running sale total for everyone; with view_costs also Cost, Yield, Cult Commons (with the rate when every line shares it) and BICII yield after Cult Commons, from `work_order_totals_staff`, marked "Provisional" while a live line has no cost entered (D14), with what to do about it. It is PLAN Phase 5's job yield panel (no second economics block): for view_costs holders the job page also reads `work_order_yield` (`getWorkOrderYield`, in its `Promise.all`) and passes it as `report`, which labels Cult Commons with the lines' snapshot rates ("30%", or "25–30%" when they differ, `formatRateRange`), adds the loss note shared with Today ("1 line sold at a loss: −$15.00. Losses don't reduce Cult Commons on other lines.", D1) and says when the job counts in reports: "Counted in reports on Sat, 3 Oct 2026 (completed)" from its current completion (D32), "Counted in reports once the job is completed" while open or after a reopen, or "Not counted in reports (cancelled)" on a cancelled job (final, D15; never recognised, D32). Without view_costs: the sale total only, and no recognition text anywhere on the page. |
| `Timeline` (server, `job-timeline.tsx`) | A job's events newest first: `describeEvent` titles (`src/lib/workshop-timeline.ts`), notes and reasons quoted, the actor ("Recorded outside the app" when none) and the time. Payloads carry no costs. The page shows the newest 200 (`?events=all`: 1,000); when older ones exist it says so ("Earlier ones, including the check-in, are not shown") with "Show earlier events". |
| `PhotoViewer` | Sheet: the photo enlarged (tap for full size), who can see it (`SegmentedControl` Internal / Customer / Public, applied immediately with `useOptimistic` and a toast; each level explained; Public disabled on a customer record, PLAN D13, and on a job, D19; Customer and Public disabled on a consignment item, D52, with "Agreement photos show the consignor's terms, so they stay internal." shown once), caption, and delete with a reason (two steps; Cancel returns focus to "Delete photo…"). A change that went through but could not remove the old copy from Storage is reported as done, with "Finish" (toast and inline), not as a failure; the next showing of the record finishes it anyway. |
| `LinkSegments`, `GroupChips`, `ActiveFilterChips`, `JobRow` (server, `workshop-board.tsx`) | The board's pieces as links, so every view is a URL and works before hydration: the All / My jobs / Unassigned switch (styled like `SegmentedControl`, `aria-current` on the current one); the groups as a horizontally scrolling chip row with counts ("All open" first; wraps from `sm`); the active filters as removable chips (`Remove filter: …`) and "Clear"; and the job row (whole row tappable, ≥ 64px): J- number, `StatusPill` (text + tone), bike, customer, lead or "Unassigned" (waiting tone), age ("3 d") and, for D20, a solid danger "Overdue" badge with its word. No money on the board. |
| `BoardFiltersButton` / `BoardFilterSheet` | "Filters (n)": a Sheet with statuses as checkboxes under their board group (several at once, e.g. only "Waiting on parts", which the Waiting group otherwise merges with the customer and paused), mechanic chips ("Anyone" first; jobs they are on as lead or additional), customer and bike `SearchPicker`s (the intake search action), checked in (Any, Today, Last 7 days, Last 30 days; Singapore time) and age (Any, Over 3 days, Overdue). "Show jobs" writes them to the URL (`boardQuery`); Reset clears the sheet. |
| `AssignmentsCard` | The job's "People": the lead and "Also on the job", each with Remove (toast "… removed from the job"), and "Assign": a Sheet with active staff as radio chips (their current role noted) and Lead / Additional; choosing Lead says "Replaces <lead> as lead; they leave the job." (D22), moving the lead to Additional says the job will have no lead. Read-only on collected and cancelled jobs. |
| `ApprovalSwitch` | "Customer approved extra work": a `Switch` applied at once (`useOptimistic`, toast; it snaps back if refused) that keeps the stored note, with an optional approval note saved by its own button (shown only when changed); the note follows the stored one when the page brings a newer one. Hidden on collected and cancelled jobs, where the flag shows as a badge. |
| `NoteButtons` / `NoteSheet` | "Add note" and "Add diagnosis" (any status): a Sheet with one textarea (1–5,000 characters) that keeps what was typed when refused; the note is append-only, in the timeline, and the sheet's `newId()` note key makes a retry add one note. |
| `EditDetailsButton` / `DetailsSheet` | "Edit" on Requested work: requested work (required), condition on arrival, internal notes and completion notes; only the fields changed since the sheet opened are sent (a colleague's newer text elsewhere is kept); an emptied note is cleared; a failed save shows what was typed (`values`). One "… updated" timeline entry names what changed. |
| `JobHistoryList` (server) | A bike's service history and a customer's jobs, newest first: J- number, status, the first line of the requested work (with the bike on a customer's page), checked-in / completed / collected dates and the lead; each row opens the job. |
| `ServiceSheet`, `NewServiceButton`, `EditServiceButton` | manage_inventory: name, category (`Select`, "No category (Other)"), price, the cost only with view_costs (on edit, empty keeps the current cost), description, Active and Public switches; `newId()` key; values kept on failure (controlled state); the snapshot note; editing also offers `ArchiveControl` (kind `service`). |
| `CategoriesEditor` (`categories-card.tsx`) | manage_inventory: service categories with Rename (in place) and Archive, "New category", and archived ones with Unarchive. Written through the RLS client; never deleted. |
| `ScheduleRateButton` / `CancelRateButton` | Admin, D21. Schedule: a percentage (up to 2 decimals, converted exactly to the 4 dp fraction, `percentToRate`) starting Now or Later (a Singapore `datetime-local`, never past), then a second step in place saying it applies to lines added from then on and never changes existing lines; its confirm button is disabled for 400 ms and focus starts on Back; the sheet's `newId()` rate key makes a retried "now" one rate. Cancel (a future rate only): "Cancel…" opens a confirmation with focus on "Keep it" and "Cancel rate" disabled for 400 ms. |
| `StockBadge` (server or client, `stock-badge.tsx`) | A product's stock as a `Badge`: tone and words from `stockTone` / `stockLabel` (`src/lib/inventory.ts`): danger "Out of stock" or "−2 (recount needed)" (D23), waiting at or below the reorder point, done "34 in stock"; a unique product "2 available". `label` keeps the tone with other words: the part picker's "12 at Shop floor · 20 total", a part line's "37 left at Shop floor". |
| `RoleBadge` (server or client, `role-badge.tsx`) | A staff member's role as a `Badge` with its word (D90): Admin (info), Manager (progress), Mechanic (neutral). Used on Settings → Your profile and Settings → Staff. Your profile's card "Your role and access" puts it beside the title, then the role's one line (`ROLE_DESCRIPTIONS`), then one checked row per effective permission (label and description; an exception on top of the role carries an `ExtraAccessBadge` "Extra access" in the waiting tone, the same component as the staff list, D92), "Record refunds" for admins and managers (D94) and, for admins, "Admin settings"; a mechanic with nothing extra reads "Workshop access only: …". History reads the pre-D90 value "staff" as Mechanic (`roleLabel`). |
| `AdjustStockButton` / `AdjustStockSheet` | adjust_stock, counted products: location (`SegmentedControl`, each segment with its count, the default location first), Add / Remove, quantity with steppers, Adjustment / Damaged (Damaged disabled when adding), a required reason with quick-fill chips ("Stock count correction", "Found stock", "Damaged in workshop", "Opening stock count"), a unit cost when adding (view_costs only, optional), a live "Shop floor: 34 → 31" right under the quantity; a result below zero is shown there as an alert (the quantity marked invalid and described by it) and the submit disabled (insufficient_stock), so the reason is in view next to its cause on a phone. `newId()` request id made when the sheet opens. |
| `StockTransferButton` / `StockTransferSheet` (`stock-transfer-sheet.tsx`) | manage_inventory: From (locations holding stock, with counts), To (the other active locations), quantity (or the unit, fixed) and an optional reason; "Move stock". Not `transfer-sheet.tsx`, the bike ownership transfer. Counted products from the product page; a unit from its own page while available or reserved. |
| `ProductSheet`, `NewProductButton`, `EditProductButton` | manage_inventory. New: Quantity / Unique first (read-only afterwards), name, SKU, brand, category (`Select` of `product` categories), description, sale price, cost (view_costs only; on edit, empty keeps it), reorder point (counted only), Active. Unique adds the first unit on the same sheet (`UnitFields`: location, serial, "Condition (shown publicly when published)", unit sale price, unit cost with view_costs, and an optional "This is a complete bike" `SearchPicker` over shop bikes with no owner and no unit, saying customer bikes must be transferred first); both the product and the unit carry their own `newId()`, and a refused unit leaves the product, whose page offers Add unit (the swallowed failure is still logged, at error level when it is not a refusal). With Unique chosen and no active location, Add product is disabled (the unit fields show `NoActiveLocation`); Quantity stays possible. Creating opens the product. |
| `AddUnitButton` / `AddUnitSheet`, `EditUnitButton`, `WriteOffUnitControl` (`unit-sheet.tsx`) | Add unit: `UnitFields` with the unit id as key. Edit details (manage_inventory): serial, condition (public once published), own price, cost (view_costs; empty keeps), internal notes. Write off (adjust_stock, units in stock): `ReasonConfirm` whose request id is made when the confirmation opens. |
| `AddPartButton` / `AddPartSheet` | "Add part" beside Add service and Add manual line, locked the same way (D15). A `SearchPicker` over saleable stock (archived, inactive, customer-owned and unavailable units left out; consigned stock offered since Phase 6 step 3, D27 as changed, D44; a unique product found by name offers its available units), each option with name, P-/U- number, SKU, price, a `StockBadge` and, for consigned stock, an info `Badge` "Consigned · <consignor>" (counted stock adds the FIFO-head C- number, D45) and a note in the sheet that the consignor is owed their agreed amount once the job is completed. Consigned counted stock never goes below zero: instead of the D23 warning the sheet says "Only N of this consigned item at <location>. Consigned stock can't go below zero." (the database refuses). Then a counted part: quantity with steppers and "Take from" segments with their counts (default location chosen); a unit: quantity 1 at its own location. The selling price, an optional "Price each" for anyone (D14; required when the part has none, D24), a cost and yield preview only with view_costs, a line total. More than the location holds shows the non-blocking D23 warning ("Only 1 at Shop floor. Adding 2 takes the count below zero; …"). Success toast "Added 2 × Road inner tube. 37 left at Shop floor." With no active location, the sheet (like Adjust stock, the unique part of New product and the product page's Stock card) shows `NoActiveLocation`: "No active stock location. Ask someone with inventory access to add one in Settings → Locations", the last words linking to `/settings/locations`. |
| `MovementList`, `HistoryList` (server, `movement-list.tsx`) | Movements newest first: signed quantity first (tabular, `text-done-deep` in, `text-danger-deep` out, a real minus sign), the label (`movementLabel`: "Used on job", "Returned from job", "Adjustment", "Damaged", "Transfer in/out", "Received"), the J- link and `#id`, the product and unit (linked; left out on the product's own page), location · actor · time (Singapore), the reason quoted, "Reverses #n" / "Reversed by #m" anchors to `#movement-{id}` (to the movements list when the other row is not on the page), and the unit cost only when the DTO carries it. `HistoryList` renders product and unit events through `describeProductEvent` / `describeUnitEvent` (`src/lib/inventory-history.ts`): "Cost changed" never shows a value; a unit's job-driven status reads "Put on job J-…", "Sold when J-… was completed", "Back on hold: J-… was reopened". |
| `PublicationControls` (`publication-card.tsx`) | The product page's Publication card (D26): status pill and what it means; the manual moves as buttons from `publicationActions` (over `manualPublicationTargets`): Make internal, Publish, Unpublish, Archive listing, Restore; never Sold; a sold product offers only Archive listing with "Sold items return to public automatically if the sale is reversed."; no Publish for a unique product without an available unit. Buttons are keyed by status and disabled for 400 ms after each change (`useArmedAfter`). While not public: "Publishing needs" with a tick or cross per requirement (`publicationChecklist`: a name, a sale price, a public photo, and for unique products an available unit, computed from the loaded data; the database stays the authority), Publish disabled and described by "Still needed: …". Refusals (`publication_requires_*`, `publication_sold_by_sale`) show their mapped message inline and as a toast. Then the QR label URL (`CopyText`) and `PublicPreviewPanel`. Moves only for manage_inventory; everyone sees the status, URL and preview. |
| `PublicPreviewPanel` (server or client, `public-preview.tsx`) | "What the public sees": the record's `reporting.public_items` row as staff read it (name, price, availability, condition for a unit, the public photo count), or "Not public. Anonymous scans show nothing." Read-only, also on the unit page. |
| `CopyText` | A value as selectable monospace text with Copy (Clipboard API; without it, e.g. plain http on a LAN iPad, it selects the text and says to copy it). The QR URL comes from the one server helper `src/lib/qr.ts` (`qrUrl`), never from an env read in a page. |
| `SplitToUniqueButton` / `SplitToUniqueSheet` | "Split off as unique item" on a counted product's Stock card, only for staff with adjust_stock and manage_inventory (D28): name (the product's), Take from (active locations holding stock, with counts), serial, "Condition (shown publicly when published)", sale price (the product's to start with) and a required reason (480 characters: the ledger adds "Split to U-…: "). The new product id and unit id are `newId()`s made when the sheet opens; success toasts "Split off as U-…" and opens the new unit. |
| `NewLocationButton`, `EditLocationButton`, `LocationActiveSwitch` (`location-controls.tsx`) | Settings → Locations (manage_inventory): a sheet with name, kind (`Select`: Shop floor, Workshop, Storage, Off-site) and sort order, the new location's `newId()` as its key; the Active `Switch` applies at once with `useOptimistic` and a toast, and a location still holding stock snaps back with the `location_has_stock` error toast. |
| `CameraPermission` (`camera-permission.tsx`) | The camera's state when there is no picture: Phase 0's messages (checking, allow, allowed, blocked with the iPhone Settings path, unsupported) plus "needs a secure connection" and "would not start", with "Allow camera" / "Try again" where pressing helps. `cameraErrorState` maps getUserMedia errors onto them. |
| `Scanner` (`scanner.tsx`) | The Scan screen; see "Scanning" below. |

### Sign-in

- **`/login`** (`src/app/(auth)/login/`, PLAN D10, D70): two steps on one
  page, no navigation between them, so it behaves the same in a browser
  tab and in the installed app (codes, never links). Step 1: Email
  (`autocomplete="email"`, email keyboard) and "Email me a code". Step 2:
  "Check your email", "If {email} belongs to BICII staff, we've emailed a
  6-digit code. It expires in 10 minutes." (identical for unknown and staff
  emails), Code (`inputMode="numeric"`, `autocomplete="one-time-code"` so
  iOS offers the code from Mail; a pasted "123 456" is accepted), "Sign
  in", "Send a new code" (disabled with a live "Send a new code in 0:59"
  countdown for 60 s after each send, counted on the device's clock; a
  resend says "We've sent a new code." in a polite status) and "Use a
  different email" (back to step 1, email kept). One action state for both
  steps (`signInStep` routes on `intent`), every form carries `next`.
  Errors show in one `role="alert"` above the step. Only an error about
  what was typed marks the field `aria-invalid` and points its
  `aria-describedby` at the alert: an email that is not an email, an
  email without access ("This email doesn't have access to BICII Admin.
  Ask an admin to invite or reactivate you."), a missing or malformed
  code, a refused code. "Too many attempts. Wait a minute and try again."
  and "Sign-in is unavailable right now…" mark nothing, because retyping
  cannot help. Focus goes to Code when step 2 opens or a code is refused,
  and to Email after an error there, either way. Asking again for an
  address Auth will not email yet (its per-address interval) shows "Check
  your email" exactly as for any other address (D70). The code is never
  echoed back. Under the form: "No access? Ask an admin to invite or
  reactivate you in Settings → Staff." Full-width 56px primary buttons, 48px secondary ones.
- **Invites** (Settings → Staff → Invite): an admin picks the Role in a
  `SegmentedControl` (Admin, Manager, Mechanic; Mechanic chosen first) with
  each role's one line listed under it, the chosen one in ink; anyone else
  reads "They join as a Mechanic." (D93). The success view says "{email}
  can now sign in.", "They join as a <Role>." and how (the email, then the
  emailed code; no password to hand over), with "Invite another" and "Set
  extra access" ("Open their page" for an admin).
- **Staff roles** (Settings → Staff, D90-D93). The list shows each
  person's `RoleBadge`, then a plain line for what the role includes ("All
  permissions", "Every permission except Manage staff", "Workshop access
  only"), then "· Extra:" and an `ExtraAccessBadge` per exception (the
  waiting tone, which no role uses, so an exception never reads as a
  role). The person
  page opens with the **Role** card: the role's label and one line; for an
  admin a `SegmentedControl` "Role" and an outline "Change role…" (off
  until another role is picked; on their own row every segment is
  disabled with "You can't change your own role." under it); others read
  "Only an admin changes roles.". "Change role…" opens a `Sheet` "Change
  <name> to <Role>?" listing what changes (`roleChangeSummary`: what the
  new role has, exceptions it includes and so removes, what is lost), an
  optional "Why?" textarea (`REASON_MAX_LENGTH`, 500) and "Change role",
  disarmed for 400 ms (`useArmed`). Focus starts on Cancel, as for other
  consequential confirmations whose reason is optional: the admin reads
  what changes before the phone keyboard can cover it. The change is sent
  with the role the sheet showed (`expected_role`); if someone changed it
  meanwhile, nothing changes and the sheet says "Someone changed their
  role in the meantime. Reload and try again." Any refusal shows as an
  alert in the sheet; success toasts "<name> is now a <Role>". The **Extra access** card states "Included in
  the <Role> role: …" in words and offers switches only for what the role
  does not include. History lines come from `describeStaffEvent`
  (src/lib/staff-events.ts): "Added as <Role>", "Role changed from <From>
  to <To>", "Extra access: <Permission> granted/removed".

### Inventory

- **Screens.** `/inventory` (search by P- number, SKU, name or brand;
  All · Low stock · Archived as links keeping `?q=`; rows with `StockBadge`
  and a publication pill when public or sold; New product for
  manage_inventory; a Movements link), `/products/[id]` (large P- number,
  publication pill, stock by location with the total, low-stock and
  "recount needed" notes, units for unique products, prices, photos,
  recent movements, history, archive), `/units/[id]` (large U- number,
  status, location, condition, serial, ownership, the bike and "On job
  J-…" / "Sold on job J-…", prices, photos, movements, history, write
  off) and `/inventory/movements` (product chip, location segments, kind
  chips All / Jobs / Adjustments / Transfers, "Load more" by `?before=`).
  Each has a `loading.tsx`; an unknown id is not-found. The Inventory tab
  and rail item stay active on `/products` and `/units` (`also` in
  `nav.ts`).
- **Permissions shown as absence.** Adjust stock and Write off need
  adjust_stock; Transfer, Edit details, Add unit, New product and Archive
  need manage_inventory; anyone may add a part to a job. Buttons a staff
  member cannot use are not rendered.
- **Cost and yield gating.** Products, units and movements have no column
  grant on their costs, so the domain lists columns (never `select *`) and
  reads cost, expected yield and Cult Commons from `product_costs`,
  `inventory_unit_costs` and `inventory_movement_costs` only for view_costs
  holders; the DTO otherwise has no such key. Product and unit pages show
  them under "Cost and yield (staff with cost access only)".
- **Selling prices** shown anywhere come from `public.selling_prices`
  (`private.selling_price`), never recomputed in TS, so Phase 6's
  consignment price flows through; edit forms edit the product default and
  the unit's own price.
- **Stock photos** are Internal or Public only (stock has no customer;
  `attachment_stock_never_customer`): "Public photos appear on the QR page
  once the item is published."
- **Parts on jobs.** A part line shows its P-/U- number (linked) and what
  is left where it came from; voiding says "Voiding returns 2 to Shop floor
  (a reversal is recorded; nothing is deleted)." and toasts "Returned to
  stock"; a reopen of a job with a unit line adds "U-000001 goes back on
  hold for this job. To return it to stock, void its line after
  reopening." (D25); the timeline reads "Used 2 × … (P-…) from Shop floor"
  and "Returned 2 × … to Shop floor".
- **Publication card** (`PublicationControls`, after Prices and Units on
  the product page): status, the manual moves, the requirement checklist
  with Publish disabled until all are met, the QR label URL with Copy and
  "What the public sees". The unit page has a read-only "Public listing"
  card: "Listing follows P-… (its product's publication status)", a link
  to change it there, its QR URL and its own `public_items` row.
- **Split off as unique item** sits with Adjust stock and Transfer on a
  counted product's Stock card (both permissions); the new item is a draft
  at the same location and keeps the source's cost (D28).
- **Locations settings** (`/settings/locations`, listed in Settings): the
  services-settings pattern: readable by every staff member, with its own
  `loading.tsx` (no permission gate below it; `/settings` itself keeps
  none), edit controls only with manage_inventory. Rows show kind and sort
  order, a "Default" pill on the default location (active, lowest sort
  order, then name: `listLocations`' `defaultLocationId`) and "Inactive";
  Add and Edit open a sheet, Active is a switch applied at once. Nothing is
  deleted; a location holding stock cannot be switched off.
- **Bike stock card**: a bike that is a unique unit shows a "Stock" card on
  its page, "In stock as U-000001 · Available" (`unitStatusLabel`; "Stock
  unit U-… · Sold" once it has left stock) linking to the unit, with the
  note that it cannot go to a customer or be archived while in stock. The
  transfer sheet and `ArchiveControl` show the `bike_in_stock` message when
  that is refused.

### Consignment

Phase 6 step 3 (SPEC §13; D4, D44–D48, D50–D52). Every screen is readable
by every active staff member; consignment money (balances, amounts owed,
charges, payments, history, agreement photos) renders only for
`canViewConsignmentMoney` (manage_consignments or view_costs, D48) and
is absent, not greyed, otherwise; the yield preview only for
`canViewSaleCosts`. Writes need manage_consignments; their buttons are
absent without it.

| Status or balance | Pill tone | Words (`src/lib/consignment.ts`) |
|---|---|---|
| Item active | info | For sale |
| Item sold, outstanding > 0 | waiting | Sold, awaiting payment |
| Item sold, outstanding = 0 | done | Settled |
| Item sold, outstanding < 0 | info | Overpaid |
| Item sold, money hidden | done | Sold |
| Item returned / withdrawn | neutral | Returned / Withdrawn |
| Balance > 0 (`outstandingLabel`) | waiting | $300.00 owed |
| Balance = 0 after something was owed or paid | done | Settled |
| Balance = 0, nothing ever owed or paid (`outstandingLabel` with the owed and paid history) | neutral | Nothing owed yet |
| Balance < 0 | info | Overpaid $40.00 (consignor owes the shop), never "credit" (D46), with one line of remedies |

| Component | Notes |
|---|---|
| `ConsignorSheet`, `NewConsignorButton`, `EditConsignorButton` | Name (required), phone, email, an optional `CustomerPicker` link that prefills empty fields, payout details (never shown back: on edit, empty keeps them), internal notes; `newId()` key; creating opens the consignor. |
| `ConsignorPicker` | `SearchPicker` over active consignors (`searchConsignorsAction`); its action row "New consignor "<typed>"" hands the text to the intake. |
| `ReceiveItemButton` / `ConsignmentIntakeSheet` | Four fieldsets, each `min-w-0` so a segmented control scrolls inside its row instead of widening the sheet past a phone screen: consignor (preset, picker, or a new consignor with an optional customer link, created by the intake RPC in the same transaction with its own id, so a refused intake leaves no consignor); what (One item (bike, frame, wheelset) / Several identical; a shop bike `SearchPicker` for one item (no owner, not in stock; prefills name, brand, serial; D51 hint), name, brand, description, category, serial and condition or a quantity stepper, "Kept at" as segments for up to 4 active locations, else a select); money (amount owed per item, 0 allowed, D24; asking price; a "If it sells at the asking price: yield · Cult Commons · BICII keeps" preview for view_costs); paperwork (received date sent as NULL when left at today, notes). Item, product, unit and consignor ids are made when the sheet opens; every value is state, so a retry sends the same request. Toast "C-000123 received", then the item page. |
| `ConsignmentItemRow` (server) | A RowList row: C- number and status pill on the first line, the name on its own line (never squeezed out on a phone), details, and the amount owed for money users. |
| `EditTermsButton` | Amount owed and asking price; a "Why is the amount owed changing?" field appears (required) once the amount owed differs. |
| `AddChargeButton` / `ChargeSheet`, `VoidChargeControl` | Description, amount (> 0) and "Who pays?" as a `SegmentedControl` with nothing chosen; "Add charge" is disabled until one is (D4), with one explanation line per bearer; Shop pays disabled with the reason for quantity items (D45) and once the unit is on a job or sold. Void is a `ReasonConfirm`. |
| `ReturnToConsignorControl` | The `ReasonConfirm` pattern with a `newId()` return id made when it opens; quantity items add where from (the locations holding this item's own stock, D54) and How many (by default all of this item's stock there, "N here, M left with the shop"); the confirm button names the effect ("Return 1 to consignor"). |
| `RecordPaymentButton` / `SettlementSheet` | Amount paid, paid on (today: NULL; else noon Singapore, `paidAtFromDate`), reference, notes; one row per owed item, oldest sale first, with its `outstandingLabel` and an amount; Auto-fill (`autoAllocate`), "Add another item"; a live "Unallocated $x" / "Over by $x" / "Fully allocated" status (the done tone only once an amount is entered and allocated; before that "Enter the amount paid" in the neutral sunken style); a row above what is owed reveals a required "Why pay more than is owed?" (D47). The commit names the amount ("Record payment of $200.00") and is disabled while `allocationProblems` blocks. |
| `ReverseSettlementControl` | `ReasonConfirm` on a payment; the reversal id is made when it opens. A reversed payment stays listed, struck through, with "Reversed: <reason> · <who> · <date>". |
| `PayoutDetailsReveal` | "Show payout details" (manage_consignments) fetches them on demand and shows them inline with Hide; they are never in the page's data. |

Pages: `/consignment` (`LinkSegments` Consignors / Items as `?view=`; the
items' status filter For sale / Sold / Returned / All as links; a
consignor row reads "N for sale · N awaiting payment" for money users and
"N for sale · N sold" otherwise, never who is owed money),
`/consignment/consignors/[id]` (contact, payout details, Balance card,
items grouped Awaiting payment / For sale / Settled and returned (for
staff without money access: Sold / For sale / Returned), Payments,
Archive) and `/consignment/items/[id]` (C- header with consignor, U-/P-
and B- links; Details with "Sold through" jobs and sales; Money card with
the hint "What we pay the consignor when it sells. It is the cost of the
sale."; Charges; Listing photos on the product; Agreement photos;
Return; History as a "Timeline" list, newest first). Phase 4 pages: a
consigned product or unit hides Adjust stock, Split, Add unit and Write
off and says "Consigned stock changes through sale, restock, a job or
return to the consignor." (D50); a consigned unit's Edit details keeps
its price and cost (they are the consignment's terms) and the unit page
gains a Consignment card; a consigned product lists its consignments; a
job's consigned part links "Consigned · <consignor>" to its item.

#### Sales (Phase 6)

Sale status (`saleStatusLabel` / `saleStatusTone` in `src/lib/sales.ts`;
a refund changes only the status, D49):

| State | Tone | Label |
|---|---|---|
| `recorded` | done | Recorded |
| `partially_refunded` | waiting | Partly refunded |
| `refunded` | danger | Refunded |
| `voided` (reserved, never written) | neutral | Voided |
| A line restocked | info badge | Restocked |

| Component | Notes |
|---|---|
| `RecordSaleButton` / `RecordSaleSheet` | "New sale" on `/sales`, "Sell" on the consignment item, unit and product pages (any staff, D48; a Sell entry point presets its item by searching its short ID). Lines: title, short ID, "3 in stock at Shop floor" (a unit: "At Shop floor"), "Consigned · <consignor>" (a consigned quantity row is one consignment and the line sends its `consignment_item_id`, D45), a money `NumberInput` prefilled with the database selling price (`unit_price`), a quantity stepper capped at what the row holds, Remove. `priceWarnings` under the price: "Below the asking price" for everyone, "Below cost: this sale loses money" for view_costs (D53; never blocks). Add item reveals the picker again; Customer (optional `CustomerPicker`, walk-in otherwise); "Sold earlier?" reveals a shop-time `datetime-local` (max now; NULL while closed or empty); Notes. A view_costs "Preview" (cost, yield, Cult Commons) per line and in total, through `previewSale` (`lineEconomics`). Footer: the Decimal running total and "Record sale · $X". The sale id is made when the sheet opens; errors show as an alert, the lines stay, and a unit sold meanwhile is outlined with "Already sold or taken. Remove this line.". A refusal is shown where it applies: Sold at, Customer and Notes carry their field errors (a time after the moment of submitting is caught in the sheet with "Enter a date and time that is not in the future."; the database's `sale_recognized_in_future` and `sale_before_stock` land on Sold at too), the first marked field takes the focus (`useFocusFirstInvalid`), and a refusal with no field scrolls the alert into view and focuses it. A preset whose search fails (a dropped connection) falls back to the picker with the "no longer available" note instead of "Finding the item…". Success: toast "S-000123 recorded" and the sale page. |
| `SaleablePicker` | `SearchPicker` over `searchSaleableAction` (`saleable_stock`): U-, P- and C- numbers, SKU, serial, name. Each result: title and price, short ID, a `StockBadge` with where and how many, the consignor badge; a unit already on the sale is disabled. |
| `RecordRefundButton` / `RefundSheet` | Admins and managers only (`canRecordRefund`, D94 amending D49), shown while something is left to refund. Amount defaults to `refundableAmount` and is capped at it; the info note "A refund does not put anything back in stock. If the item came back, restock it separately." (D7); the reason through `ReasonConfirm` ("Record refund of $5.00…" then "Refund $5.00"); the refund id is made when the sheet opens. |
| `RestockControl` | `ReasonConfirm` "Restock… U-000123" on a unit line still sold on this sale (`unit_sold_sale_line_id` = the line) and on the unit page's Restock card; for adjust_stock holders, and for a consigned unit only with manage_consignments too (D46). It always sends this line's id; "Back to" location segments (default: where it was sold) while confirming when there is more than one active location; a consigned unit says "It goes back on sale for the consignor and is no longer owed to them." |

Pages: `/sales` (`PageHeader` "Sales" with New sale; range links Today /
7 days (default) / 30 days as `?range=`, Singapore shop days; a
`SearchField` whose query searches every date; rows with the S- number
and time, Partly refunded / Refunded, Restocked and Consigned badges, the
first item "+N more", the customer or "Walk-in", the total and, for
view_costs, "Yield $x · Cult Commons $y"; empty state "No sales in this
period") and `/sales/[id]` (the S- number as the h1, status, date and
time, "In store", the customer link or Walk-in, "Recorded by …", Record
refund; Items: each line linked to its unit, consignment or product,
quantity × price and total, "Consigned by <name> · C-…" and, for
consignment money users, "owed $500.00, paid separately", a bike line's
link and "Ownership is not transferred automatically; use Transfer on the
bike page." (D51), Restocked with when and by whom, per-line cost, yield
and Cult Commons for view_costs, Restock; a "Yield" card for view_costs:
Sale, Direct cost (incl. consignor payout), Yield, Cult Commons (30% of
positive yield), BICII after Cult Commons; Refunds with what is left to
refund; Notes). The unit page shows "Sold on S-…" and a Restock card when
a sale sold it. Today's "Consignment sales" tile links to that shop
day's sales, `/sales?day=YYYY-MM-DD` (today or a past day; the Sales
page's heading names the day and no range is current), and "New
consignor liability" (view_financial_reports and view_costs, D30) to
`/consignment`; both always show an amount now.

### Scanning

- **Scan screen** (`/scan`, `Scanner`): mobile-first; the square
  viewfinder (a yellow-bordered square over a dimmed `<video playsInline
  muted autoPlay>`) fills the width on phones and is capped at `max-w-md`
  on iPad; "Hold the label inside the square."; a Torch on/off toggle when
  `track.getCapabilities().torch`; under it, always, "Or type the code on
  the label" (`autoCapitalize="characters"`, autocomplete off,
  `enterKeyHint="go"`) with Open, which goes to `/q/{code}` when it parses
  (a short ID in any case, or a pasted BICII label URL) and otherwise says
  "Enter a code like P-000123". It works with no camera at all. The page
  pads its bottom like every page, so the raised Scan tab and toasts never
  cover the field.
- **Decoder choice**: `BarcodeDetector` when it exists and
  `getSupportedFormats()` includes `qr_code`, run at most ~6 times a second
  on `requestVideoFrameCallback` (else a throttled `requestAnimationFrame`);
  otherwise `@zxing/browser`'s `BrowserQRCodeReader.decodeFromVideoElement`,
  imported dynamically only then, so ZXing (~470 KB) is never in the first
  load.
- **Camera lifecycle**: `getUserMedia({ video: { facingMode: "environment" } })`
  starts at once when access is already granted, otherwise after "Allow
  camera". Every track stops on unmount, on `visibilitychange` to hidden
  and on `pagehide`, and before navigating away on a hit; the camera
  restarts when the page is visible again. A session counter makes a late
  async step of an old start give up. Errors map onto `CameraPermission`'s
  messages (blocked, unsupported, needs HTTPS, would not start).
- **What a code means** (`interpretScan`, `src/lib/scan.ts`): a BICII label
  is `{base}/q/{shortId}` for an accepted public base (`scanBases()` in
  `src/lib/qr.ts`: today `NEXT_PUBLIC_PUBLIC_SITE_URL`; Phase 8 adds the
  database QR base there and nowhere else), a `/q/{shortId}` URL on the
  Admin's own origin, or a bare short ID. A hit vibrates (30 ms), stops the
  camera and pushes `/q/{shortId}`. Anything else shows "Not a BICII
  label" with the text cut to 60 characters, keeps scanning and ignores the
  same text for 2 s. A foreign code is **never** opened, followed, fetched
  or rendered as a link, whatever its scheme.
- **The /q resolver** (`/q/[shortId]`, the only Admin /q route):
  `requireStaff()`, then `resolveShortId` (`src/lib/domain/scan.ts`: the
  prefix picks the table, RLS-scoped, archived records included) and
  `redirect()` to the page from `hrefForRecord` (`src/lib/ids.ts`, also used
  by search hits). An unknown code renders the not-found content in the
  shell: "No record with P-999999", Scan again and Search. It has no
  `loading.tsx`: a loading boundary would commit a 200 before the redirect
  (see "Loading"). Later phases extend `resolveShortId` (C- and S- in Phase
  6, PO- in Phase 7) instead of adding routes.
- **Header short-ID jump**: see `HeaderSearch`; the same /q route answers
  it, so a typed B-/J-/P-/U- number and a scanned label land the same way.

### Workshop

- **Cost visibility.** Cost, yield and Cult Commons figures exist in a
  job's data only for staff with `view_costs`: the domain reads lines from
  the base table's cost-free columns (or `work_order_line_items_staff`)
  and totals from `work_order_totals` (or `work_order_totals_staff`), so
  a DTO for anyone else has no `costs` key to hide. Screens never filter
  numbers out of a fuller object; entering a cost (a service override or a
  manual line's cost) is offered only with `view_costs` and refused by the
  action and the RPC otherwise (D14). The timeline carries no costs for
  anyone.
- **Intake photos follow creation.** `record_attachment` needs the job row
  to exist, so the wizard creates the job first and lands on
  `/jobs/{id}?intake=photos`: the "Intake photos" card comes first there,
  with the camera prominent, the upload tiles and "Done" (which drops
  `?intake`). The upload queue lives above the pages, so leaving early
  loses nothing.
- **The board** (`/jobs`, SPEC §7.2): a list of rows by group rather than
  columns, so it works one-handed on a phone (Kanban is optional). Order:
  title with "New job" (on phones a full-width button at the top instead),
  the view switch, the job number box (`SearchField`, exact number however
  typed) and Filters, the active filter chips, the group chips with counts,
  then one section per non-empty group, oldest check-in first (the
  longest-waiting bike on top). "All open" shows every group but Closed;
  a group chip shows that group alone; Closed lists jobs collected or
  cancelled in the last 30 days (any time when a job number is typed),
  newest first, 50 at a time with "Show more". Counts follow every filter
  but the group. The board reads at most the newest 300 open jobs; past
  that it shows the usual truncation notice and says "Counts cover the
  newest 300 open jobs." Empty states differ per view ("No jobs assigned
  to you — pick one from Unassigned", with a link there).
- **Services settings** (`/settings/services`, every staff member): the
  services by category with price and Inactive / Not public badges, the
  cost only with view_costs, Active / Archived (`ArchivedFilter`), and the
  note "Changing a price or cost affects new job lines only; existing lines
  keep their snapshot." The Cult Commons card (view_costs only) shows the
  rate in force large, scheduled rates (admins: Cancel) and earlier ones
  with who set them and when, cancelled ones marked "Cancelled". It has a
  `loading.tsx` (no permission gate below it).
- **Job page order** (phone): header (J- number, status, overdue badge,
  bike, customer with tap-to-call, check-in date and age), status actions,
  intake photos (intake only), requested work and condition, lines with
  totals, photos; then people (`AssignmentsCard`), dates (each stamp its
  own row: completed and collected never merge), notes (always shown:
  `ApprovalSwitch`, internal and completion notes, Add note / Add
  diagnosis) and the timeline, a second column on wide screens. "Edit" on
  Requested work opens the details sheet.

### Today

`/` (SPEC §19.1; PLAN D30–D35), components in `src/components/domain/today/`
(server unless noted), reads in `src/lib/domain/reports.ts` over the Phase
5 read RPCs, shapes and wording in `src/lib/reports.ts`.

- **The database decides which day is today** (D35). The page asks
  `today_dashboard` for the `?day=` given (a real `YYYY-MM-DD` before this
  server's shop day), else for null; if the database refuses an explicit
  day as in its future (clocks either side of Singapore midnight) it asks
  again with null, so a day choice never errors. Every other read, label,
  the Next-day link (disabled on today) and the date input's `max` use the
  `day` and `is_today` the database returned. A garbage `?day=` is today,
  and so is one before `EARLIEST_SHOP_DAY` (2000-01-01, the date input's
  `min`; Previous day is disabled on it). `parseShopDay` reads years
  0001-9999 as themselves and `shiftShopDay` only returns days that parse
  back, so no derived day (the week strip's) can throw while rendering.
- **Flows vs snapshot** (D31). "Today" / "On Sat, 3 Oct": Checked in,
  Started, Completed, Ready for collection, Collected (Cancelled when > 0),
  the jobs whose current stamp falls on the day; each links to its list in
  Activity. "Right now" (today only): Received, Waiting, Ready to start,
  In progress, Awaiting collection ("Completed, not yet collected": the
  Completed and Ready for collection statuses together, D31, so it never
  shares a name with the flow tile, the status or the board's Ready for
  collection column) and Overdue ("Open more than 7 days",
  `OVERDUE_AFTER_DAYS`), the current snapshot grouped as `BOARD_GROUPS`,
  each linking to the board filtered the same way (`TILE_LINKS`). A past
  day has no snapshot, no low stock and no "Needs attention".
- **Permissions** (D30). Money needs View financial reports: without it
  the section is not rendered at all. Inside it, COGS, Yield, Cult Commons
  and BICII after Cult Commons need View costs too; without it one line
  says "Costs, yield and Cult Commons need the View costs permission." The
  database returns hidden figures as NULL and the DTO keeps them null; the
  UI never derives one. Workshop, stock and exception counts are for all
  active staff; an adjustment's value at cost only with View costs.
- **Money notes.** Danger: the loss note (D1). Warning: "Provisional: N
  lines have no cost entered…" (D14). On a past day, muted: "Counts jobs
  completed and sales recorded on this day. If a job is reopened, it moves
  to the day it is completed again." (D32; words, not colour).
- **Appointments** (Phase 2, D30, D41). `AppointmentsSection`: Scheduled
  ("Booked for this day"), Arrived ("Including checked in") and No-shows
  from `today_dashboard`, by scheduled day and current status, for every
  staff member; the placeholder treatment only for a row the database did
  not count. On today its `children` is `TodayArrivals` (streamed):
  "Still expected" (booked or confirmed, linking to the day view) and
  "Arrivals", the first five expected, late ones first, each a row (time,
  customer, type, solid "Late") opening `/appointments/<id>` with the name
  "10:30, Hafiz Rahman, Service drop-off, late"; "See all" opens
  `/appointments?date=<day>`; "N more expected later"; empty: "No more
  arrivals expected today" with Book. A past day shows only the counts.
- **Consignment tiles (Phase 6).** "Consignment sales" (the day's sales
  and completed jobs with a consigned line, count and total; the hint says
  "N sales or jobs with consigned items"; links to that day's Sales list,
  `/sales?day=`, where the sales are; the jobs are under Jobs completed) and,
  for view_costs, "New consignor liability" (what the day's consigned
  lines owe their consignors; links to Consignment) always show an amount.
  Money also counts in-store sales: Gross sales is jobs completed and
  sales recorded on the day.
- **Needs attention links to the full list (Phase 9).** Beside the
  section's count, "See all" (named "See all exceptions" for screen
  readers, the low-stock "See all" pattern) opens `/reports/exceptions`,
  and the capped-list note ("Showing the 20 most urgent of 45") is a link
  there too. Nothing else on Today changed: the same `ExceptionList`, the
  same 20 rows, no second tile. The Activity and Stock grids are
  `grid-cols-1` on phones (with `min-w-0` items), so a long customer or
  bike name truncates instead of widening the page (found in Phase 9 step
  4's E2E run).
- **Streaming.** The dashboard row loads first; each list (financial
  entries, adjustments, low stock, exceptions, activity, last 7 days) is a
  `SectionLoader` (async) in its own `<Suspense>` with a `SectionSkeleton`,
  and a failed read logs and shows "Couldn't load this. Refresh the page to
  try again." in place. Still no `loading.tsx` at the group root (see
  "Loading").
- **Layout.** Phone: one column, two-column tile grids, 44 px targets;
  from md three or four columns and the lists side by side. Numbers are
  `font-display tabular-nums`. Every tile is a `<dl>`/`<dt>`/`<dd>`; a
  linked tile's name is "Completed: 3"; money tiles show the currency
  code; section headings are `<h2>`. A money amount never leaves its card:
  the tile's `<dl>` is a size container, the amount's size is a share of
  its width picked by the amount's length (`moneySizeClass`, capped at the
  usual size, floored at 1rem) and the currency code wraps under it when
  both do not fit, so "$400.00" stays large in a half-width phone tile and
  "$12,345.67" shrinks beside the iPad side rail.

| Component | Notes |
|---|---|
| `StatTile`, `MoneyTile`, `TileGrid`, `TodaySection` (`stat-tile.tsx`) | A figure as `<dl>` with label, value, hint, optional link, tone (value colour only) and `notTracked` ("—" and `NOT_TRACKED`, "Not tracked yet", for screen readers: the one source of that wording); money formatted with a real minus sign and its currency, scaled to the tile (see Layout); the grid; a section with its `<h2>`. |
| `AppointmentsSection`, `TodayArrivals` (`appointments-section.tsx`) | The appointment tiles and the expected arrivals, above. |
| `DayNavigator` (client) | ‹ Previous day / Today / Next day › links and a `next/form` GET form (`<input type="date" name="day">` with `min` and `max`, "Go"); works before hydration; once hydrated a picked date submits after a 600 ms pause (typing a year passes through "0002"). |
| `RefreshButton` (client) | "Updated 10:42 am" and Refresh: `router.refresh()` in a transition with a spinner; returning to the tab refreshes once the figures are a minute old. |
| `ActivityList` | One flow's jobs from `work_order_activity_on`: J- number, status pill, Overdue badge, customer, bike, sale total; the heading's id is the flow tile's anchor. Checked in, Completed and Collected always; Started, Ready for collection and Cancelled when not empty; "Nothing happened on this day" for a quiet day. |
| `AdjustmentList` | The day's adjustments and damaged stock: signed delta, P- link, reason, type · location · actor · time, a "Significant" badge (D33) and the value at cost when present. Significant ones first, then newest first; the first `ADJUSTMENT_ROWS` (5) listed and the rest behind a `<details>` "Show N more" (no JavaScript), so an opening stock count does not push "Needs attention" screens down. |
| `LowStockList` | The first 5 of P4's `reporting.low_stock` (largest shortfall first) with `StockBadge`; "See all" opens `/inventory?filter=low`. |
| `ExceptionList` | D34 exceptions, danger first: pill (tone and words; Overdue is danger, as on the Overdue tile and the board's badge, while Not collected and other warnings are waiting), short ID, subject, `exceptionCopy` sentence; rows link through `exceptionHref` (a line opens its job via `/q/J-…`); unknown kinds render a generic sentence; keyed by `exceptionKeys` (a product below zero at two locations is two rows); Today lists the 20 most urgent and, when there are more, says "Showing the 20 most urgent of 45" under them (with `moreHref`, a link to `/reports/exceptions`); EmptyState "Nothing needs attention". Phase 9 adds optional props only (`detailed`, `action`, `label`, `empty`, `moreHref`): without them a row renders exactly as before (a unit test compares the markup). |
| `FinancialEntries` | `<details id="financial-entries">` "What makes up these figures" (open with `?entries=open`): the day's `financial_lines` grouped by job (J- link), description, quantity, sale, and yield and Cult Commons when visible; "Sold at a loss" and "Cost pending" badges. It adds nothing up. |
| `WeekStrip` | "Last 7 days" ending at the day shown: completed, collected, and gross sales, yield and Cult Commons when visible; each day links to `/?day=`; the day shown has `aria-current="date"` and a bold row. A table from md, stacked cards on a phone. |
| `SectionLoader`, `SectionSkeleton`, `SectionError` (`section-loader.tsx`) | The streaming pattern above. |

### Appointments

`/appointments`, `/appointments/[id]` and `/appointments/[id]/check-in`
(SPEC §6; PLAN D2, D36–D42), with Today's tiles and arrivals, the
customer page's section, the job's link back and the schedule settings. Reads in
`src/lib/domain/appointments.ts`; the grid, statuses, history wording and
times in `src/lib/appointments/` (pure: `slots.ts` mirrors the database's
slot functions exactly, `status.ts`, `history.ts`, `time.ts`,
`format.ts`, 24-hour "10:00–10:30" in shop time).

- **The list** is a URL: `?date=` (shop-local today when missing or not a
  real day) and `?view=day|week`; Day/Week links styled like
  `SegmentedControl` (`LinkSegments`), Today, ‹ › by a day or a week. The
  Monday–Sunday strip sticks under the header: 64px day links with the
  weekday, date, the count of appointments that are not cancelled (D41)
  and "Closed" / "Short day" ("Short" on phones), `aria-current="date"` on
  the day shown and the whole day in its accessible name.
- **The day view** groups rows by start time; each row links to
  `/appointments/<id>` (the href is the E2E locator) and shows the time
  range, `StatusPill`, "Booked online", a solid "Late" (15 minutes past a
  booked or confirmed start), a "Note" badge, and a solid waiting badge
  "Outside opening hours" / "Shop closed" for an active booking a
  settings change left behind (D38: settings never move bookings, so
  screens flag them; closure first, the grid is not a reason to warn).
  Cancelled ones fold under "N cancelled". A closed day is an EmptyState
  "Closed: <reason>" with the next open day, still listing its bookings;
  custom hours are a banner "Short day 12:00–16:00: <reason>" ("Different
  hours" when not shorter). Capacity is one slim bar per slot with its
  words ("1 of 2 booked"; red and "3 of 2 booked" when over), beside the
  list from lg. The week view is an agenda whose columns follow its own
  width (a container query, so the side rail counts): stacked on phones,
  two to four columns on tablets, seven only from 72rem; each row has the
  time, `StatusPill` and the day view's badges, which wrap inside a narrow
  column rather than run into the next day.
- **Booking** (`BookAppointmentSheet`, props `open`, `onOpenChange`,
  `presetCustomer`, `lockCustomer`, `presetDate` (a past date falls back
  to today); `BookAppointmentButton` with the same presets, `label`,
  `buttonVariant`, `size`, `disabled` and `variant` "button" (md+) or "fab", the phones' yellow Book above the tab bar,
  right of Scan): customer (`CustomerPicker`, or a fixed name when locked;
  "New customer…" links to Customers rather than nesting a sheet), type
  as radio cards (staff-only types badged), date as a 14-day chip strip
  plus a native date input, times as a 3–4 column grid of 44px radios
  with "N left", bike ("Decide at check-in" first), the two notes. One
  `loadSchedule` per 14-day window; every day's times are computed in the
  browser, so changing type or day is instant and "Next day with free
  times" needs no request. Radios are native inputs inside their cards
  (`sr-only` inside a `relative` label), so arrows move within a group and
  the focus ring is drawn on the card (`has-[:focus-visible]`). The form
  submits through `onSubmit` with controlled state (nothing typed is ever
  reset); a slot refusal is the Time field's error (focus and scroll go
  there, an error toast says it too), reloads the times and keeps the
  rest. The free times are computed against the server's clock
  (`ScheduleData.asOf` plus the time since the load), not the device's.
- **The detail page** wraps its content in `AppointmentStatusScope`
  (`useOptimistic` status shared by `AppointmentStatusPill` in the header
  and `AppointmentActionBar`), so Arrived changes the pill at once. The
  bar sticks above the tab bar on phones and sits under the header from
  md: the next step first (Arrived, Check in, or Reinstate as arrived on
  the no-show's own day), then Check in, Confirm, "No-show…" (confirm
  without a reason: focus on Cancel, "Mark no-show" disabled 400 ms) and
  "Cancel appointment…" (`ReasonConfirm`, "Keep appointment"); every
  button rests 400 ms after a status change (`useArmedAfter`). Cards:
  Job (once checked in), Customer (tap to call), Bike (Change before
  check-in), Notes (Edit sends only changed fields), Details, History
  (plain sentences with actor and time).
- **Check-in** (`CheckInForm`): bike cards (the appointment's
  preselected) with "Add a bike" opening `BikeSheet` with the owner
  preset and its `onCreated`; New job / Existing job J-… when that bike
  has open jobs without an appointment; requested work prefilled from the
  customer's note, condition on arrival and `LeadPicker` (the intake's
  lead chips, extracted to `lead-picker.tsx`: "Me" first, Unassigned
  last); one sticky "Check in and open job". A refusal no field explains
  also shows as an error toast beside that button. A new job opens on its
  intake photos step (`/jobs/<id>?intake=photos`).
- **Status → tone** (`appointmentTone`, `StatusPill` with its words):
  Booked info, Confirmed progress, Arrived waiting, Checked in and
  Completed done, No-show danger, Cancelled neutral (struck through in the
  week agenda and the customer page). Completed is never a button (D36:
  the job completes it). Two-step rules: No-show confirms without a reason
  (focus on Cancel, the confirm rests 400 ms); Cancel is `ReasonConfirm`
  (required reason, "Keep appointment"); cancelled and completed are final
  (D39).
- **Source badge**: "Booked online" (info) on customer bookings in every
  list; the customer page shows "Booked by staff" (neutral) too.
- **Schedule warning badges** (D38): solid waiting "Outside opening hours"
  / "Shop closed" on a row, and "N appointments affected" on a closure in
  settings, linking to the first affected day.
- **Customer page**: an Appointments card (upcoming from today, soonest
  first, then "Past" with the latest five; `CustomerAppointmentRows`: day
  and time range, `StatusPill`, source badge, type, bike and job) with
  "Book appointment" (`BookAppointmentButton` with `presetCustomer`,
  `lockCustomer`, `buttonVariant="outline"`, `size="sm"`, `disabled` for
  an archived customer, like Add bike).
- **Job page**: a "Booked appointment · Tue 6 Oct 10:00 · Service
  drop-off" chip under the header when the job came from an appointment;
  the timeline's `appointment_linked` line reads "Opened from the
  appointment on …" (check-in created the job) or "Linked to the
  appointment on …", and its title is a link (`EventDescription.href`).
- **Schedule settings** (`schedule-settings.tsx`, client sheets; admin
  only, each submits through `onSubmit` with controlled state and stays
  open on a refusal): Booking capacity (`NumberInput`s: slot length,
  bikes per slot, minimum notice, how far ahead, online bookings per
  customer, online cancellation cutoff; read-only it shows the D2 sentence
  "Up to 2 bikes can be booked in for each 30-minute slot.", "Customers
  can cancel online until 2 hours before." and "Singapore time");
  `WeeklyHoursList` (Monday first, "10:00–19:00" / "09:00–12:30,
  13:30–18:00" / "Closed"; for admins each row is a button opening the
  day's sheet: "Open on <weekday>" `Switch`, up to four interval rows of
  time inputs with add and remove, 00:00 as a closing time meaning
  midnight, overlap and order errors listed on the group); closures (an
  "Add closure" / Edit sheet: `SegmentedControl` Closed / Short day, first
  and last day, "Only part of the day" for Closed (forces one day), opens
  and closes for a short day, reason; "Delete…" with `ReasonConfirm`,
  named for its closure ("Delete the Tue 13 Oct closure…"); past
  ones under a collapsed "Past"). Every save toasts the upcoming bookings
  the schedule no longer fits, with "Show" opening the first such day.
  Closures and types carry a `newId()` from the sheet (Add sends `isNew`).
- **Appointment types** (`/settings/appointment-types`,
  `AppointmentTypeSheet`): rows with name, duration, units, Public / Staff
  only, Inactive (inactive last) and sort order; the admin sheet has name,
  description, duration, capacity units (at most the shop's), "Public"
  ("Customers can book this on the BICII website"), Active and sort order.
  Types are never deleted, and the page says so.

### Photos and images

- Photos are shown with `next/image` **unoptimized** (a plain lazy `<img>`
  with width and height), not through the image optimizer, so there is no
  `images.remotePatterns` entry for Storage: internal photos are
  short-lived signed URLs (5 minutes, minted on every render, one
  `createSignedUrls` call per record), which the optimizer would fetch and
  cache on the server under URLs that change every render, keeping private
  photos in a server cache; and the devstack's Storage is on a loopback
  address the optimizer refuses without `dangerouslyAllowLocalIP`. Public
  photos use their public URL. Thumbnails are therefore the uploaded
  photos (at most 2048 px, typically 200–600 KB), loaded lazily.
- A signed URL that has expired by the time it loads (a page left open)
  triggers one `router.refresh()` (at most once a minute) to mint new ones.
- Who sees what: **Internal**, staff only; **Customer**, staff and the
  bike's current owner (or the customer, for a customer-record photo) on
  the BICII website once customer accounts launch (Phase 11); both live in
  the private `media-internal` bucket. A job photo's Customer level means
  the job's customer. **Public**, anyone with the link (`media-public`);
  never for a customer record (D13) or a job (D19): the app refuses before
  copying anything to `media-public`, and the database refuses too. Changing to or from
  Public moves the object between buckets (`src/lib/domain/attachments.ts`
  explains the order of steps and what a failure leaves); whatever a failed
  cleanup leaves is removed the next time the record is shown.

### Search

- Lists are search-first: an empty query shows recently updated records,
  a query shows `staff_search` hits (exact B- numbers and serial numbers
  first; serials ignore case, spaces and dashes).
- `/search` groups hits by kind (Customers, Bikes, Jobs, Products,
  Units), the group with the best hit first: an exact J- number
  ("j-000004", "J000004") puts Jobs first, an exact P- number or SKU puts
  Products first. The search fields are labelled "Search customers, bikes,
  jobs and stock". Product hits show the RPC's subtitle ("SKU · brand · 34
  in stock"), unit hits their status first ("Available · Shop floor ·
  S/N …"). An exact short ID typed in the header skips the results and
  opens the record (`/q`). Archived search returns no jobs.
  Recent searches are kept per device in `localStorage`
  (`src/lib/recent-searches.ts`: every access in try/catch, at most eight,
  newest first) when a query is submitted or a result opened, and shown
  before anything is typed. They never reach the server.

### Purchasing

Phase 7 (SPEC §14, §21; PLAN D60–D66). Screens under `/purchasing`,
components in `src/components/domain/purchasing/`, reads in
`src/lib/domain/purchasing.ts` and `src/lib/domain/suppliers.ts`, labels,
tones and sentences in `src/lib/purchasing.ts`, form schemas in
`src/lib/purchasing-forms.ts`.

- **Route group and the 403 rule.** The browsing screens live in the route
  group `src/app/(staff)/purchasing/(browse)/` (no URL segment): `/purchasing`
  (orders), `/purchasing/orders/[id]`, `/purchasing/suppliers` and
  `/purchasing/suppliers/[id]`. The group's `layout.tsx` adds
  `PurchasingNav` (the layout is not async: the staff read deciding whether
  Reorder shows sits under `<Suspense>`, so the nav and skeleton stream at
  once; every page calls `requireStaff()` itself), its `loading.tsx` the
  list skeleton, and each record
  route has its own `loading.tsx`. There is no `loading.tsx` at
  `/purchasing` itself: a loading boundary there would sit above the
  manage_purchasing pages beside the group (receiving and reorder, step 4)
  and turn their `forbidden()` into a 200 (see "Loading"). Those pages go
  outside `(browse)`. Unknown or malformed ids render not-found.
- **Cost gating (D60).** Purchase costs (line unit costs and totals,
  receipt costs, PO totals, supplier last costs, cost defaults, PO history)
  are for `view_costs` or `manage_purchasing` (`canSeePurchaseCosts`,
  mirroring `private.can_view_purchase_costs`). The domain reads them only
  from the `*_staff` views and only for those staff; the DTO otherwise has
  no `costs`, `totals` or `history` key. Every write needs
  manage_purchasing; controls a staff member cannot use are not rendered.
  Totals are `purchase_order_totals_staff`'s, never summed in TypeScript.
- **Closed orders (D61, D65).** Received and cancelled orders have no
  editing. A received order shows "Fully received … Extra or late units go
  on a new order." and, for manage_purchasing, "New order for <supplier>"
  (the preset sheet; full width and wrapping on a phone, so a long name
  never widens the page). Cancelling is final and keeps what arrived.
- **Product page.** Shop-owned counted products get a "Suppliers & orders"
  card (consigned products show their Consignments card instead, D62)
  (`ProductPurchasingCard`): supplier links (each with "Last cost $x ·
  date" for `view_costs` holders only: the product page is not a
  purchasing screen, so `manage_purchasing` alone shows no cost here,
  D60), "On order: N"
  (`reporting.product_on_order`: submitted and partially received only),
  the open orders holding the product, and Add supplier for
  manage_purchasing.

| Component | Notes |
|---|---|
| `PurchasingNav` (`purchasing-nav.tsx`) | Orders · Suppliers as links in a scrolling pill row, `aria-current` on the active one (Orders also on `/purchasing/orders/*`), 44px targets, inset focus ring. Step 4 adds Reorder with its page. |
| `PurchaseOrderStatusPill` (server) | Draft (info), Submitted (waiting), Partially received (progress), Received (done), Cancelled (danger); always with its text. |
| `QuantityProgress` (server) | `role="progressbar"` with `aria-valuenow` = received, `aria-valuemax` = ordered and `aria-valuetext`, plus the same words visibly: "18 of 20 received · 2 to come", "20 of 20 received", "18 of 20 received · 2 cancelled" (`progressText`). A cancelled remainder is hatched, never "to come". A draft (its `status`) reads "15 items · not submitted": nothing is to come until it is sent, as `product_on_order` leaves drafts out (D66); the order list and a supplier's orders use the same words. |
| `PurchaseOrderSheet`, `NewPurchaseOrderButton`, `EditPurchaseOrderButton` | New order or Edit details; body mounted only while open. New: `newId()` made on open is the order's id and idempotency key; the supplier is picked (`SupplierPicker`) or PRESET with the `supplier` prop (a supplier's page, a received order's "New order for …", step 4's closed receive page), expected date (native date input), supplier reference, notes; Create opens the draft. Edit: the supplier is fixed once submitted, with why. The server sets the currency. |
| `PurchaseOrderLines` | The order's lines: one DOM with explicit table roles ("Order lines"), stacked rows on a phone and an upright iPad, a dense table (`text-dense`, `tabular-nums`) once its card is 42rem wide (a container query, as `LineTable`: the card, not the screen). Product (P- link, SKU, on hand), `QuantityProgress`, expected date or a solid danger "Overdue" badge, and only for cost-visible staff unit cost and line total. On an open order a manage_purchasing row is a button ("Change line: …") opening the line sheet. |
| `PurchaseOrderLineSheet`, `AddPurchaseOrderLineButton` | Add: `PurchaseProductPicker`, the unit cost prefilled from `purchase_cost_defaults` with a hint naming its source (supplier's last cost / product cost / none); a cost typed meanwhile wins. Both: quantity with steppers, never below what was received (`minimumQuantity`), unit cost 0–99,999.99 (0 is a known cost, D24 as amended), the line's expected date, notes, a live line total, and an optional reason once submitted. Edit: Remove line, two steps (a reason unless draft, `ReasonConfirm`), disabled with why once part of the line arrived. The line id is the idempotency key. |
| `SubmitOrderButton`, `CancelOrderControl` (`purchase-order-actions.tsx`) | Submit: one explicit button with a pending state, no confirm, armed 400 ms after it appears. Cancel: `ReasonConfirm` (required reason, the confirm moved and re-keyed, 400 ms guard, "Keep order") saying that items already received stay in stock and that cancelling is final; it sits in its own "Cancel order" card at the bottom. |
| `SupplierSheet`, `NewSupplierButton`, `EditSupplierButton` | Name, contact name, phone, email, website (https:// added when left out), account reference, notes; `newId()` key; values echoed back on failure; Create opens the supplier. |
| `SupplierProductSheet`, `AddSupplierProductButton`, `EditSupplierProductButton` | A supplier–product link: the supplier fixed and the product picked (supplier page), or the product fixed and the supplier picked (product page); supplier SKU, lead days, a Preferred switch whose hint says it replaces another preferred supplier; edit adds Remove link (two steps, no reason: a link is a relationship). Never the last cost: receiving sets it (D63). |
| `SupplierPicker` | `SearchPicker` over active suppliers (`staff_search` kind `supplier`) through `searchSuppliers`. |
| `PurchaseProductPicker` | `SearchPicker` over orderable products (D62: quantity-tracked, shop-owned, active, unarchived) through `searchPurchasableProducts`; each option "On hand N · On order M · P-000123"; products already on the order are shown but not choosable. Not the job-only `searchParts`. |
| `ProductPurchasingCard` (server) | The product page's "Suppliers & orders", above. |
| `ReceiveForm` (`receive-form.tsx`, on `/purchasing/receive/[id]`) | Step 4. A focused page outside `(browse)` (manage_purchasing, real 403): "Receive PO-…", the supplier, a back link, "Received in the last 24 hours" (this PO's receipts of the last 24 hours: the time for today's, the date and time for an earlier day's), then the form. ONE controlled client component, not a form action (React never resets what was typed), running the pure state machine in `src/lib/receive-form.ts` (`receiveReducer`, unit-tested): `starting` → `editing` → `submitting` → done, or `checking` → `recorded` / `notRecorded`, or back to `editing` on a definite refusal, or `closed`. **Key lifecycle:** the receipt's idempotency key is `newId()` when the form first mounts, stored with the values and a `pending` flag in sessionStorage under `bicii:receive:<poId>` (every access in try/catch; the page works without storage); `pending` is set BEFORE the call. A stored key (pending or not) is looked up (`purchase_receipt_by_key`) before anything is editable. The key survives definite refusals (nothing was written under it) and retries; a NEW key comes only with fresh values ("Receive another delivery", whose defaults are the new outstanding quantities); never a new key with old values. **Unknown outcome** (the action threw: network lost, response aborted, or an unexplained failure): the error toast "We could not confirm the receipt. Checking whether it was recorded…" (dismissed once answered), the form read-only with "Checking whether this delivery was recorded…"; found → `recorded`: "This delivery was recorded at 10:42 am by Asha Admin (18 items)", Open PO-… (the receipt's own PO if it differs) and "Receive another delivery"; not found → "It was not recorded. Retrying is safe: it will not be received twice." with Retry (same key, same values; editing allowed, key kept); lookup failed → still read-only with "Check again". `purchase_receipt_key_reused` is treated as found. Definite refusals: `purchase_over_receipt` → editing, `router.refresh()` for the new outstanding numbers and per-line messages; `purchase_order_closed` → the closed state; the D64 date codes → on the Received field. Submitting: inputs read-only, the commit button `aria-busy` and disabled (a ref also drops a second tap before the re-render), "Still confirming…" after 20 s. Success: storage cleared, toast "Received 18 items. 2 still to come." or "Order fully received.", `router.push` to the order. **Lines:** stacked cards on a phone and an upright iPad, a grid with column headers (Product · Ordered · Received · To come · Receive now · Unit cost · Location) once the card is 56rem wide (container query); each line a `role="group"` named by its product. Receive now: `NumberInput` quantity with steppers clamped 0..outstanding, defaulting to the outstanding quantity; more typed shows "Only 2 still to come. Raise the ordered quantity on the order first." (D65) and blocks the commit. Actual unit cost: money, 0 allowed, prefilled with the PO cost, hint "Ordered at $12.00" and a neutral "Differs" badge. Location: a native select (locations are few) following the form-level "Receive into" (default: Phase 4's `defaultLocation()`, or the last one chosen on this device, localStorage `bicii:receive-into`). Lines at 0 are dimmed and not sent; "All to come" and "Clear all". **Duplicate delivery note (D65):** a reference matching one of this PO's receipts (trimmed, case-insensitive) shows "DN-5531 was already recorded at 10:42 am by Asha Admin (18 items)" with a "This is a different delivery" checkbox; the commit stays disabled until it is ticked. **Shop-time date:** a `datetime-local` showing now (shop time, `toShopLocal`); `receivedAt` is sent only when changed (`fromShopLocal(...).toISOString()`), else the server uses now(); min = max(now − 30 days, submitted_at), max = now (D64); the server stays authoritative. **Footer:** sticky above the tab bar and home indicator, ONE row at every width (the summary takes what the button leaves): "N items on M lines", a value preview (lib/money; never authoritative) and "Receive N items" (the explicit commit, no confirm step, SPEC §22; md on a phone, lg from sm). A page with a sticky footer (`data-sticky-footer`, here and on Reorder) gets a root `scroll-padding-bottom` of the footer plus the tab bar (globals.css, `html:has(...)`), so a focused field scrolls clear of them (WCAG 2.4.11). A received or cancelled PO shows the closed state instead ("This order is fully received. Extra or late units go on a new order." with "Start a new order for this supplier", the preset `PurchaseOrderSheet`; or "This order was cancelled."), both linking back. |
| `ReorderList` (`reorder-list.tsx`, on `/purchasing/reorder`) | Step 4 (D66; manage_purchasing, real 403; `PurchasingNav` shows Reorder to manage_purchasing holders; Reorder links also on the Inventory "Low stock" filter and Today's low-stock tile). `SupplierPicker` at the top, required to create, preset from `?supplier=` (choosing one replaces the URL, and the list is remounted keyed by supplier). "Below reorder point" from `reorder_suggestions` (shop-owned products only; a consigned product below its reorder point never appears, D62): each row a 44px `Checkbox` row with the name, P- id, SKU and the supplier's SKU when linked; "On hand 3 / reorder at 10", "On order 2", "Suggested 15" or "Covered by open orders"; badges "Preferred" / "Preferred supplier: …" and "In draft PO-…"; for cost-visible staff the draft's default cost and where it comes from. Rows linked to the chosen supplier with a suggestion above 0 start ticked. Sticky footer "Create draft order (N products)" (full width and allowed to wrap on a phone, so the page never scrolls sideways): `create_purchase_order_from_low_stock` with an id made when the list mounts (a double tap opens the same draft), then the draft, where quantities and costs are edited before Submit. Empty: "Nothing is below its reorder point." with "Shop-owned counted products at or below their reorder point appear here. Consigned stock is never reordered." The Today and Inventory Reorder links follow the general low-stock count, so with only consigned products low they lead to this empty list. |

### Reports

Phase 9 (SPEC §19.2, §21, §22; PLAN D30, D100–D105;
[ADR-022](decisions/ADR-022-reporting.md)). `/reports` and `/reports/lines`,
components in `src/components/domain/reports/` (`report-controls.tsx`
client, `report-sections.tsx` server), reads in
`src/lib/domain/period-reports.ts` over the step 1 RPCs, the vocabulary,
period model and URL state in `src/lib/period-reports.ts`, the CSV export
table in `src/lib/report-exports.ts`.

- **Period and basis live in the URL** (`period, date, from, to, basis,
  by`, and the cursors `after_total, after_key` on `/reports`, `after_at,
  after_id` on `/reports/lines`). `ReportControls`, sticky under the app
  header: the Period segmented control (Day, Week, Month, Custom), a
  stepper ("Previous week" / "Next week", 44 px; Next is disabled when the
  next period would start after today), the range as a button (a native
  date picker for day, week and month; the Custom sheet for a range) and a
  ghost Today when the period does not contain today. `[` and `]` step
  the period when focus is not in a text field. The Custom sheet checks
  the range with the database's own messages (`report_range_invalid`,
  `report_range_too_long`) and keeps the values on an error. Weeks are ISO
  (Monday–Sunday), months calendar months, days shop days. Every change is
  `router.replace` in a transition (scroll and focus kept, a spinner on
  the control), like `SearchField`. `BasisControl` (Sale date, Check-in,
  Completed, Collected, D100) shows the basis's description under it and
  changes only `basis`; changing it keeps the period and `by`.
- **Tiles and cost gating.** The figures are `dl/dt/dd` tiles (Today's
  `StatTile` and `MoneyTile`), two columns on a phone and six across at
  `lg`: Gross sales and "Jobs · sales · lines" always; Direct costs,
  Yield (danger and the word "Loss" when negative), Cult Commons ("Sum of
  30% of each line's positive yield") and BICII after Cult Commons with
  View costs only. A withheld figure (NULL from the database, D30) is
  hidden, never shown as 0; without View costs one line says so. On the
  sale basis a second row adds consignment sales and, with View costs,
  new consignor liability, settlements paid and received from suppliers;
  refunds are their own line, "Refunds recorded: $x (n) — not deducted
  from the figures above" (D102). Lines in another currency are a warning
  linking to `/reports/exceptions` (D104). Without View financial reports
  the financial part is one sentence and there is no basis control.
- **Buckets.** Not for a single day: one row per day, ISO week or month
  (`autoGrain`: days up to 31, weeks up to 184, else months), partial
  buckets marked, with a thin `aria-hidden` bar whose width is the
  bucket's gross over the largest gross (two database strings divided
  with `toDecimal` for presentation only; the value is in text).
- **Breakdown rows versus the table.** A link strip of the dimensions
  (`aria-current` on the chosen one; it changes only `by`). Phones get
  `RowList` rows (label, detail, gross on the right; with View costs
  "Yield $x · CC $y", a loss in danger-deep); from `md` a dense table
  (caption, `th scope`, sticky header, tabular numbers; Qty for products;
  Cost, Yield, Cult Commons and After CC with View costs) scrolling inside
  its own box. 25 groups a page, "Showing the top 25" and "Show more"
  with the keyset cursor. A job or sale group opens its page; every other
  group opens `/reports/lines`. An empty period says "Nothing recorded for
  this period on the <basis> basis." and, on Sale date and Completed,
  "Jobs not completed yet only show on the Check-in basis."
- **Now versus the period.** "Stock at cost now" (D105) is a figure for
  this moment whatever period is chosen, and says so: quantity on hand and
  units per ownership, shop-owned items without a cost ("n items have no
  cost and are not valued"), and with View costs the shop-owned value;
  consigned and customer-owned stock is counted, never valued. Activity
  (everyone) counts each job on its own date (D31), appointments by the
  day they were booked for (D41), and lists jobs by lead mechanic (D103;
  inactive staff marked, lead-less jobs "Unassigned").
- **Export links** are plain `<a target="_blank" rel="noopener">` with an
  `aria-label` naming the table ("Export CSV: breakdown by Job / sale"),
  never `next/link`, whose prefetch would run the export. `_blank` because
  in the iOS standalone PWA a download in the app's own window replaces
  the app with the file; a new window opens Safari's viewer, with Share
  and Save to Files (SPEC §22, ADR-001 A7).
- **No loading.tsx under `/reports`** ([Loading](#loading)):
  `requireStaff()` / `requireStaff('view_financial_reports')` runs before
  anything streams, then each section streams in its own `<Suspense>`
  with a `SectionSkeleton`; a failed section says so in place
  (`SectionLoader`). `/reports/lines` reads its header group before
  streaming, so an unknown key is a real not-found.
- **More reports.** The links at the bottom of `/reports` open
  Exceptions (with the caller's count as a Badge, waiting tone when above
  zero, from `report_exception_counts`; nothing while it loads) and Stock
  reconciliation.

#### Exceptions and reconciliation (Phase 9 step 4)

PLAN D34, D104, D106–D108. `/reports/exceptions` and
`/reports/reconciliation`, both `requireStaff()` (any active staff
member; the database decides which exceptions each person sees, D108),
no `loading.tsx`, each part streamed in its own `<Suspense>`. Words and
URL state in `src/lib/reconciliation.ts`, reads in
`src/lib/domain/reconciliation.ts`.

- **Read-only screens link to the guarded fix, never fix.** Nothing on
  either page changes stock, status or money (D106). A row opens its
  record (product, unit, consignment item, job, sale), where the guarded
  flow lives: Adjust stock with a reason, restock, settle, void, return.
  For adjust_stock holders an issue row on Reconciliation adds "Fix with
  a stock adjustment", a link to the product page where Adjust stock is.
  The only write on either page is the admin's threshold.
- **Exceptions.** PageHeader "Exceptions" ("Things the records say cannot
  be right, or that need someone's attention. They clear themselves when
  the cause is fixed.") with Export CSV. Sections in this order, each an
  h2 with a count Badge and shown only with rows: Stock below zero (with
  a note: a job part may take stock below zero, so count and adjust),
  Items in an impossible state, Shopify needs attention (no rows until
  Phase 10; never a fake row), Lines in another currency, Unsettled
  consignments, then Overdue jobs, Not collected and Stale holds; a later
  phase's unknown kind falls under "Other". Each section is
  `ExceptionList` with `detailed`: a StatusPill "Critical" (danger) or
  "Needs attention" (waiting) because the heading names the kind, the
  short ID, the title, the subject, the sentence (`exceptionCopy`; for a
  consignment "Sold 45 days ago; $2,000.00 outstanding to <consignor>",
  the amount as the database computed it), the database's detail when it
  says more, and the age ("45 days", the date on hover and "· since
  21 Aug 2026" from md up). Stock and unit rows add a secondary link
  under the row, "Open stock reconciliation", filtered to the product
  (`RowLink`'s `after` slot: links never nest). A line above says how
  many exceptions there are and when they were checked; when the counts
  exceed the 200 listed, it says so. All clear: EmptyState (done tone)
  "No exceptions" with the time checked.
- **Threshold sheet.** Admins see "Alert unsettled consignments after N
  days" and Change, which opens a Sheet ("When to flag unsettled
  consignments") with a quantity `NumberInput` (1–365, steppers, "days"
  suffix) in a Field; the value typed stays on failure with the error
  under the field ([Forms](#forms)); Save closes with a toast "Alert
  unsettled consignments after N days". Everyone else sees the sentence
  as text.
- **Reconciliation.** PageHeader "Stock reconciliation" ("Stock on hand
  is always the sum of the movement ledger. This page checks the records
  that summarise it — each unique item's status and location — against
  that ledger."). A SegmentedControl "Show" (Problems only, the default;
  Everything) kept in the URL as `all=1`, and the `product` filter (set by
  links from Exceptions and from the product page's "Check against the
  ledger") as a removable chip (a link that drops it). Sections: Stock
  below zero (its own note: allowed, but count and adjust), Products by
  location (short ID and name, location, ledger on hand, items in stock
  for unique products, the issue sentence) and Unique items (short ID,
  product, status, location versus "ledger says <location>", the
  disposition with its S-/J- reference, ledger on hand versus expected,
  the issue sentence with the database's detail, last movement date).
  Rows on phones, a dense table from md up (as the breakdown). Clear:
  EmptyState (done tone) "Every product reconciles with the ledger" /
  "Every item reconciles with the ledger". At the RPC cap of 1,000 rows a
  line says "Showing the first 1,000. Choose a product to see the rest."
  Export CSV for products by location and for unique items, honouring
  `all` and `product`.
- **Inventory.** The `/inventory` PageHeader has a "Reconcile stock"
  outline ButtonLink beside Movements.
