# BICII Admin — Data model

Companion to [PLAN.md](./PLAN.md) and [ADR-001](./ADR-001-architecture.md). The
authoritative requirements are in [SPEC.md](./SPEC.md); this document turns
them into tables, constraints, functions and views. Where this document adds
structure the spec did not prescribe (join tables, idempotency keys, generated
columns) that is implementation mechanics the agent is free to refine. Where a
choice would change business semantics it is listed under **Open decisions** in
PLAN.md (records in [decisions/](decisions/README.md)) and must not be changed
silently.

Conventions used throughout:

- Every table: `id uuid primary key default gen_random_uuid()`,
  `created_at timestamptz not null default now()`, and `updated_at` maintained
  by a shared trigger where the row is mutable. `updated_at` is not an audit
  log; auditable facts get their own event or ledger row.
- Money: domain `money_amount` = `numeric(12,2)`. Rates: domain
  `rate_fraction` = `numeric(5,4)` (0.3000 = 30%; tables add their own
  range checks). Both domains reject `NaN` (`check (value <> 'NaN')`):
  Postgres numeric accepts it, it poisons every sum, and it passes range
  checks because NaN sorts above every number. Every other numeric column
  uses a domain with the same check too (a meta test requires it), e.g.
  quantities on line items are domain `line_quantity` = `numeric(10,2)`
  (added with the first line-item table, Phase 3), with a check that
  inventory-backed lines are whole numbers. Quantities on stock
  are `integer`.
- Every money-bearing row carries `currency char(3) not null default 'SGD'`.
- Timestamps are `timestamptz`. Display defaults to `Asia/Singapore`.
- Soft delete is `archived_at timestamptz null`; archived rows stay readable to
  historical references and are hidden from pickers.
- Human IDs come from dedicated sequences, are never reused, and live in a
  `short_id` or `*_number` column with a unique index:
  `B-000123` bikes, `J-000456` work orders, `P-000789` products, `U-000012`
  inventory units, `PO-000034` purchase orders, `C-000056` consignment items.
- Enums are Postgres `enum` types. Adding a value is a migration; that is the
  intent, because statuses are business facts.
- Schemas: `public` holds tables, RPCs and views (exposed through PostgREST);
  `private` holds security-definer helpers that must not be callable through
  the API; `reporting` holds views only.

## Authority, applied state and implementation status

This section was added by the documentation retrofit (2026-10-05, inspected
at `c6bf6d0`). The numbered sections below are never renumbered; code and
migration comments cite them as "DATA-MODEL §n".

**Authority.** The schema source is the 51 files in
[supabase/migrations/](../supabase/migrations/), from
`20261004000100_foundation.sql` to
`20261006000300_staff_role_administration.sql`. Phase 6 added
`20261004003300` to `20261004003700`; Phase 8 (labels) added
`20261004003800_labels.sql` and Phase 10 (Shopify)
`20261004003900_shopify_integration.sql`,
`20261004004000_shopify_order_processing.sql` and
`20261004004100_shopify_product_sync.sql`, on `feat/p8-labels` and
`feat/p10-shopify`; Phase 7, purchasing, integrated onto the main line on
`feat/p7-purchasing`, added `20261005000100` to `20261005000500`, which
sort after every `20261004…` file; staff email sign-in, integrated on
`feat/auth-email-otp`, added `20261005005000_staff_session_revocation` and
`20261005006000_sign_in_throttle`, which sort after purchasing's and
create only new objects: no function, view, policy, grant or trigger they
define is also defined by a main-line or purchasing migration; staff
roles added `20261006000100_staff_role_values`,
`20261006000200_staff_role_permissions` and
`20261006000300_staff_role_administration`, which sort after both and
replace, with the same signatures, `private.has_permission`,
`public.my_staff_profile`, `public.record_sale_refund`, `create_staff`,
`private.authorize_permission_change`, `grant_permission`,
`set_staff_active` and `update_staff`, D90–D94. The labels and Shopify
migrations sort before the purchasing, sign-in and roles ones, and no
function, view, policy, grant, trigger or type that
`20261004003800_labels.sql` or `20261004003900` to `20261004004100`
(Shopify) creates or replaces is created or replaced by any of them
(checked at the merge of `main` into `feat/p8-labels`, and again at the
merge of `feat/p8-labels` into `feat/p10-shopify`, 2026-10-06, by
matching every `create`, `create or replace`, `drop`, `alter`, `grant` and
`revoke` target of those four files against the `20261005…` and
`20261006…` files): the labels migration's only change to an existing
object is `shop_settings_public_site_url_check`, and the Shopify
migrations' are new columns on `products`, `customers` and `sales`,
which no later migration touches. So the label and Shopify guards
(`private.require_staff`, `private.require_admin`, `private.is_staff`,
`private.is_admin`, `private.has_permission`) follow the roles unchanged:
every role prints labels, and label templates, printers and the QR
address stay role `admin` only (D91; a manager is not an admin;
`tests/db/labels.test.ts` proves both for a manager); a manager holds
`manage_inventory` (Publish online, Sync now) by role, while the Shopify
settings stay `require_admin` (D86, D91).
[src/lib/database.types.ts](../src/lib/database.types.ts) is generated from
them by `npm run db:types`, and CI fails when it drifts
(`npm run check:types` in [ci.yml](../.github/workflows/ci.yml)).
[tests/fixtures/api-surface.ts](../tests/fixtures/api-surface.ts) is the
allow-list of every function and privilege the API roles hold, enforced by
[tests/db/meta.test.ts](../tests/db/meta.test.ts). This document explains
meaning; where it disagrees with a migration, the migration wins and this
document is corrected.

**Applied state.**

- Local: on 2026-10-06, after `npm run db:reset` on `feat/p10-shopify`
  merged with the main line (`a1aebf6`; `npm run test:e2e` resets the
  same database),
  `psql postgresql://postgres:postgres@127.0.0.1:5432/bicii_dev -Atc "select count(*), max(version) from supabase_migrations.schema_migrations"`
  printed `51|20261006000300` (every file applied).
- CI: the `check` job diffs the generated types against a throwaway
  database built from the migrations, and the `test` and E2E jobs run
  `npm run db:reset` (migrations, then the seed) before testing
  ([TESTING.md](TESTING.md#ci)).
- Hosted: `npx supabase@2.119.0 migration list` per
  [RUNBOOK](RUNBOOK.md#applying-migrations-to-a-hosted-project). Never
  exercised: no hosted project exists
  ([R-001](RISKS.md#r-001--nothing-is-deployed)).

**Implementation status on this branch.** Determined by matching each
section's tables, views and functions against `create table`, `create view`
and `create function` statements in the migrations (file names below drop
the `20261004` prefix; Phase 7's keep `20261005`). For planned tables, the rows of §15 and the RPCs of
§16 are design, not schema.

| Section | Status | Where, or what is missing |
|---|---|---|
| §1 Identity and authorization | Implemented | `000200_staff`, `000300_staff_management`, `000500_staff_history`; staff email sign-in: `20261005005000_staff_session_revocation` (D71) and `20261005006000_sign_in_throttle` (D72); staff roles (D90–D94): `20261006000100_staff_role_values`, `20261006000200_staff_role_permissions`, `20261006000300_staff_role_administration`, all three applied locally (`47\|20261006000300`; screens: `src/app/(staff)/settings/staff/`, `src/app/(staff)/settings/profile/`; integration-reviewed 2026-10-06) |
| §2 Customers, bikes, attachments | Implemented | `000600_customers`, `000700_bikes`, `000800_media_storage`, `000900_attachments`, `001000_customer_access`, `001100_staff_search` |
| §3 Shop hours and appointments | Implemented | `002700_appointment_enum_values` to `003200_appointment_reporting` (Phase 2) |
| §4 Workshop | Implemented | `001300_work_orders`, `001500_workshop_rpcs`, `001600_workshop_customer_access`, `001700_workshop_search` |
| §5 Services and line items | Implemented | `001200_workshop_catalog`, `001400_work_order_lines`, `001500_workshop_rpcs`; consigned-part columns `003300_consignment`, their rules `003400_consignment_job_parts` (D44) |
| §6 Catalog and inventory | Implemented | `001800_inventory`, `002100_inventory_publication`, `002200_inventory_search`; `003300_consignment` adds the units' consignment foreign key, ownership rules and the consignment branch of `private.selling_price`; the sale-line columns have their foreign keys since `003500_sales`; the Shopify id rules (gid checks; `shopify_product_id` no longer unique, D84) since `003900_shopify_integration`; `supplier_products` is Phase 7's (§10) |
| §7 Inventory movement ledger | Implemented | `001800_inventory`, `001900_inventory_jobs`, `002000_inventory_reporting`; `003300_consignment` adds the consignment foreign key, D50's movement rules and `private.record_linked_movement`; `003500_sales` adds the sale-line foreign keys and `inventory_movements_restock_once`; `20261005000300_purchase_receiving` adds the receipt-line foreign key, `inventory_movements_purchase_received_has_receipt_line` and `private.record_receipt_movement` |
| §8 Sales | Implemented | `sales`, `sale_lines`, `sale_refunds`, `private.sell_line`, `record_retail_sale`, `restock_unit`, `record_sale_refund` (`003500_sales`; the partial unique index `sale_lines_unit_sells_once` replaces this section's plain `unique`, D46). Screens: Phase 6 step 4 (`src/app/(staff)/sales/`, `src/lib/domain/sales.ts`). Shopify orders reuse `private.sell_line` since Phase 10 step 1 (`004000_shopify_order_processing` replaces it with the same body plus `shopify_line_part`; `003900` adds the Shopify columns and `sale_lines_shopify_line_part_key`, D80) |
| §9 Consignment | Implemented | Phase 6 step 1: consignors, items, charges, item history, returns, `reporting.consignment_item_position`, consigned job parts (`003300_consignment`, `003400_consignment_job_parts`; D44–D52); step 2: settlements, reversals, the ledgers and the balance rule (`003600_consignment_settlements`; D46, D47). Screens: step 3 (`src/app/(staff)/consignment/`, `src/lib/domain/consignment.ts`); selling a consigned item in store: step 4 (Sell on the item page, `/sales`) |
| §10 Suppliers and purchasing | Implemented | Phase 7: `20261005000100_suppliers`, `…0200_purchase_orders`, `…0300_purchase_receiving`, `…0400_purchasing_search`, `…0500_purchasing_reorder` (D60–D66). Screens: `src/app/(staff)/purchasing/`, `src/lib/domain/purchasing.ts`, `src/lib/domain/suppliers.ts`. Purchases are shop-owned quantity products only (D62; consigned products are refused, `purchase_line_not_shop_owned`) |
| §11 QR identity and publication | Partly | Built: short IDs, publication rules, `reporting.public_items`, staff `/q/[shortId]`, scanner (`002100_inventory_publication`); the database QR base and payload (`private.qr_payload`, `003800_labels`, D9); the Admin's QR display and scan bases on the database base (`src/lib/qr.ts`, Phase 8 step 2). `C-` resolves to the consignment item page since Phase 6 step 3, `S-` to the sale page since step 4, `PO-` to the purchase order since Phase 7. Missing: the public `/q` route (Phase 11) |
| §12 Label printing | Partly | Database built (`003800_labels`, Phase 8 step 1: templates, printer profiles, print jobs, label content, RPCs, built-in rows); `src/lib/printing/`, `src/lib/domain/labels.ts`, the print view, the PDF route and the print history (step 2); the record pages' Labels card and the settings screens are steps 3–4; hardware adapters Phase 12 |
| §13 Shopify integration | Partly | Inbound built (Phase 10 step 1: `003900_shopify_integration`, `004000_shopify_order_processing`: settings, sync rows, events, the queue, the audit trail, webhook recording, order and refund processing, retry, dismiss and the links; D80–D89). Outbound database built (step 2: `004100_shopify_product_sync`: the online price, Publish online, Sync now, the settings RPC, the deferred enqueue triggers, the sync worker's state and result RPCs, `reporting.shopify_sync_status`, `public_items.buy_online_url`). Service layer built (step 3: `src/lib/integrations/shopify/`, the webhook and cron routes; no schema change). Screens built (step 4: the product page's Online card, `/shopify` and its queue, products, events and inspector, `src/lib/domain/shopify.ts`; no schema change). Not verified against a real store ([R-047](RISKS.md#r-047--the-live-shopify-adapter-is-unverified-against-a-real-store)) |
| §14 Reporting views | Partly | Built: `stock_levels`, `product_stock`, `low_stock`, `public_items`, `financial_lines`, `daily_summary`, `work_order_activity`, `operational_exceptions`, `appointment_daily`, and `work_order_totals` / `work_order_totals_staff` (in `public`). `consignment_item_position`, `consignor_item_ledger`, `consignor_ledger` (Phase 6; no API grant; the consignor ledgers are built and read through `list_consignors` and `consignor_statement`); `financial_lines` has its sale branch and `daily_summary` its consignment columns since `003700_consignment_reporting`. `purchase_order_progress` and `product_on_order` (Phase 7). `operational_exceptions` has its `integration_failed` rows since `004000_shopify_order_processing` (admins only, D86). `shopify_sync_status` and `public_items.buy_online_url` since `004100_shopify_product_sync` (Phase 10 step 2). Missing: `stock_reconciliation` (Phase 9) |
| §15 Row-level security matrix | Partly | Rows for every built table are implemented and tested, including consignment (Phase 6 step 1), sales and settlements (step 2, D48), purchasing (Phase 7, D60), labels (Phase 8 step 1) and the Shopify integration tables (Phase 10 step 1, D86); the rows of later phases are design |
| §16 RPC catalogue | Partly | Rows marked "Built" exist, including the five consignment item RPCs (Phase 6 step 1) and the five sale and settlement write RPCs and six read RPCs (step 2), all with screens since steps 3 and 4 (deviations from the original rows: `record_retail_sale`, `restock_unit(unit_id, sale_line_id, location_id, reason)`, `return_consignment_item(return_id, item_id, reason, quantity, location_id)`), the fourteen purchasing RPCs (Phase 7, `receive_purchase(purchase_order_id, idempotency_key, lines, reference, received_at, notes)` among them), the five label RPCs (Phase 8 step 1), the five Shopify service-role RPCs and four staff RPCs (Phase 10 step 1), and the two sync-worker RPCs and three staff RPCs of the outbound sync (step 2); the rows of later phases are design |
| §17 Sequences and short IDs | Implemented | `000100_foundation` (all seven prefixes); C is used from Phase 6 step 1 (`consignment_items`), S from step 2 (`sales`), PO from Phase 7 (`purchase_orders`) |
| §18 Seed data | Implemented | Phase 1–5, Phase 2, Phase 6, Phase 7, Phase 8 and Phase 10 parts are in `supabase/seed.sql`, in that order (Phase 10's last) |

**Access summary.** The matrix is [§15](#15-row-level-security-matrix) and
the pattern is [ADR-003](decisions/ADR-003-customer-access.md).

| Actor | Reaches | Enforced by | Test evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| anon | `reporting.public_items`, `public_appointment_types()`, `public_shop_hours()`, `available_slots()`; objects in the public bucket `media-public` by URL, with no listing ([§2](#2-customers-bikes-attachments), [§15](#15-row-level-security-matrix)); nothing else (nothing about labels) | grants, RLS, definer projections, public bucket (`20261004000800_media_storage.sql`) | `tests/db/meta.test.ts`, `inventory-publication`, `appointment-customer-access`, `labels` |
| customer (signed in) | own rows only, through `my_*` RPCs; base tables return nothing | staff-only RLS, `private.current_customer_id()` | `customer-access`, `workshop-customer-access`, `appointment-customer-access` |
| staff (active) | base tables through RLS; cost columns hidden | `private.is_staff()`, column grants, `*_staff` views | `staff-rls`, `work-order-lines`, `inventory-catalog` |
| staff with a permission (by role or as an exception) | costs, inventory writes, stock changes, financial reports, staff management, consignment money, purchasing (`manage_purchasing` held as an exception also sees purchase costs on purchasing surfaces, D60). A manager holds every permission except `manage_staff` by role (D91) | `private.require_permission` / `has_permission` (through `private.role_implies`) in RPCs; `private.can_view_purchase_costs()` | `staff-roles`, `permission-helpers`, `reporting-access`, `staff-management`, `inventory-ledger`, `purchasing-access` |
| manager or admin | retail refunds (D94, a role check: `private.can_record_refunds()`) | `record_sale_refund` | `staff-roles`, `sales` |
| admin | everything above plus settings, hours, rates, roles, admin and manager staff (D93), label templates and printers, and the Shopify integration's events, queue, audit trail, dismissals, links and `integration_failed` exceptions (D86) | `private.require_admin()`, `private.is_admin()` | `staff-roles`, `staff-management`, `staff-history`, `schedule-settings`, `labels`, `shopify-webhooks` |
| service role | bypasses RLS; exactly the allow-listed functions (`SERVICE_ROLE_FUNCTIONS`), nothing in `private`: in `src/lib/admin/` the Auth admin API (invites without a password) and `note_sign_in_attempt` (D72); since Phase 10 the Shopify webhook, queue and sync-worker RPCs (`src/lib/integrations/shopify/`) | grants (each revoked from anon and authenticated), ESLint import restriction, `server-only` | `meta` ("service_role can execute exactly the allow-listed functions"), `sign-in-throttle` (anon and staff get 42501), `shopify-webhooks` |

**Lifecycle.**

- Customers, bikes, categories, services, products and units are archived
  (`archived_at`), not deleted; stock locations and appointment types are
  switched off (`active`). Archived rows stay readable to history and hidden
  from pickers. Work orders and appointments are never deleted; they end in
  a status.
- Exceptions that are hard-deleted, each leaving an append-only event row
  with who and when:
  - photos: `delete_attachment` (any active staff member, reason required)
    deletes the `attachments` row, kept as the payload of an
    `attachment_events` 'deleted' row, and the server then removes the
    Storage object ([§2](#2-customers-bikes-attachments)); the file
    cannot be recovered (nothing is backed up,
    [R-002](RISKS.md#r-002--no-backups-monitoring-alerting-or-exercised-recovery));
  - closures: `delete_closure_override` (admin, reason required), kept in
    `schedule_events`;
  - weekly hours: `set_shop_hours` (admin) replaces a weekday's intervals,
    the old ones kept in `schedule_events` (no reason is asked);
  - permission grants (exceptions): `revoke_permission` deletes the
    `staff_permissions` row, kept in a `permission_revoked` `staff_events`
    row (no reason is asked); a role change deletes the exceptions the new
    role implies the same way, with the role change's reason (D92).
- Event and ledger tables are append-only (triggers refuse updates and
  deletes); a correction is a linked reversal or a new event.
- Financial snapshots on lines never change after the line is written.
- Short IDs come from sequences that are never reset or reused (§17).
- No retention or deletion policy for customer personal data exists
  ([R-016](RISKS.md#r-016--no-retention-or-deletion-policy-for-customer-personal-data)).
- The seed is synthetic: fixed UUIDs, `example.com` customer and
  `bicii.test` staff addresses; it is never applied to production (§18).

**Integration contracts.**

- Public site (Phase 11 consumes them; nothing in that repo uses them yet):
  the `my_*` RPCs, the three anonymous functions above and
  `reporting.public_items` (§11, §15).
- Errors: business refusals are `P0001` with a stable snake_case code in
  `MESSAGE`, mapped to user messages in
  [src/lib/db-errors.ts](../src/lib/db-errors.ts) (§16).
- Shopify: inbound built in §13 (Phase 10 step 1): the service-role RPCs the webhook route and cron call (`record_shopify_webhook`, `claim_integration_jobs`, `process_shopify_event`); the outbound sync and `reporting.public_items.buy_online_url` (the Buy-online rule Phase 11 reads, D84) came in step 2, and the service layer that calls them (`src/lib/integrations/shopify/`) in step 3.

Rules:

- Roles (D90, D91): `admin` implies every permission; `manager` every
  permission except `manage_staff` (`view_costs`, `manage_inventory`,
  `adjust_stock`, `manage_consignments`, `manage_purchasing`,
  `view_financial_reports`); `mechanic` none. New staff default to
  `mechanic`. One SQL helper holds the rule:
  `private.role_implies(role staff_role, permission permission_key) returns
  boolean` (`language sql`, `immutable`, `search_path = ''`, EXECUTE
  revoked from every API role); `has_permission` and `my_staff_profile` use
  it, so every policy, view and RPC that calls `has_permission`,
  `require_permission` or a `can_view_*` helper follows. The app mirrors it
  in `roleImplies()` / `ROLE_PERMISSIONS`
  ([src/lib/auth/permissions.ts](../src/lib/auth/permissions.ts));
  `tests/db/staff-roles.test.ts` proves the two agree for every role and
  permission.
- Effective permissions = what the role implies plus the person's
  `staff_permissions` rows; none while inactive.
- Exceptions (D92): a `staff_permissions` row is "Extra access" for one
  person on top of their role. A row the role already implies cannot exist:
  `grant_permission` refuses it (P0001 `permission_implied_by_role`), and a
  BEFORE INSERT trigger (`staff_permissions_refuse_implied`, security
  definer, reading the person's role `for share`) refuses it for every
  writer (seed, SQL editor). When a role change makes a row implied, the
  AFTER UPDATE OF role trigger `staff_role_drop_implied_exceptions` (every
  writer; named so it fires after `staff_record_history`) deletes it in the
  same transaction, which appends one `permission_revoked` event per row
  after the `role_changed` event, with the role change's actor and reason.
  A later demotion does not bring removed rows back. The triggers guard new
  writes only, so `20261006000200` also deletes, once, the rows already
  implied when it runs (`private.drop_implied_exceptions()`, security
  definer, EXECUTE revoked from every API role): before the roles an admin
  could grant to an admin and a promotion kept its rows, so a database
  migrated step by step (`db:migrate`) could hold them. Each deletion
  appends a `permission_revoked` event with no actor (no one is signed in
  during a migration) and the reason "Staff roles (D92): their role
  already includes this permission."; a fresh build has none to delete. A
  manager can therefore carry only `manage_staff` as an exception; an
  admin none.
- Refunds (D94): `private.can_record_refunds() returns boolean` (security
  definer, EXECUTE revoked from every API role): an active admin or
  manager. A role check, not a permission: no exception grants it.
- Admin-only (D91): shop settings, hours, closures, appointment types, Cult
  Commons rates, roles, and admin and manager accounts stay behind
  `private.is_admin()` / `private.require_admin()`.
- The enum value `staff` was renamed to `mechanic` (D90,
  `20261006000100_staff_role_values.sql`, `alter type ... rename value`,
  which keeps the value's OID, so stored rows and defaults followed);
  `staff_events` payloads are append-only, so a `created` or `role_changed`
  payload written before the rename still says `"staff"`, which the app
  labels Mechanic. "Staff" still means any active person
  (`private.is_staff()`).
- An update can never leave the shop without an active admin (trigger
  `staff_keep_an_active_admin`, serialised with an advisory lock).
- "Staff" in any policy means `staff.active = true` for the calling
  `auth.uid()`. Deactivating a staff member revokes everything at once.
- Deactivation also deletes the person's Supabase Auth sessions (trigger
  `staff_revoke_sessions`, D71): when `staff.active` goes from true to
  false, through `set_staff_active` or any other writer,
  `private.revoke_auth_sessions_on_deactivation()` (security definer,
  EXECUTE revoked from every API role) deletes their `auth.sessions` rows
  (refresh tokens and MFA claims cascade) and any refresh token of theirs
  without a session, in the same transaction. A refused deactivation rolls
  back with it; replays and reactivation delete nothing. An access token
  already issued and verified without asking Auth (hosted asymmetric keys)
  lives until it expires (at most `jwt_expiry`); the inactive check above
  refuses it meanwhile. The migration
  (`20261005005000_staff_session_revocation.sql`) refuses to apply where
  its role cannot delete from `auth.sessions` and `auth.refresh_tokens`
  (RUNBOOK "Applying migrations to a hosted project").
- History over overwrites (SPEC §2, §22): every insert or update of a
  `staff` row and every insert or delete of a `staff_permissions` row
  appends one `staff_events` row, written by triggers
  (`staff_record_history`, `staff_permissions_record_history`), so no path
  (RPC, seed, the RUNBOOK's first-admin SQL) skips it. A grant's actor is
  its `granted_by`; otherwise the actor is `private.current_staff_id()`. The
  reason reaches the trigger through a transaction-local setting the RPC
  sets and clears (`private.set_staff_event_reason`). Replays that change
  nothing append nothing. `staff_events` refuses UPDATE and DELETE for
  every role (`staff_history_append_only`); API roles have no grant on it
  and read it through `staff_history()`.
- Staff rows change only through RPCs: `authenticated` and `service_role`
  have no INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE on `staff` or `staff_permissions`. A BEFORE
  trigger (`staff_enforce_rules`) holds for every writer, the owner
  included: `staff.email` must equal the Auth login's email (P0001
  `staff_email_mismatch`), and a signed-in user never deactivates their
  own row (42501).
- Delegation ceiling (PLAN D11, restated for roles by D93;
  `private.authorize_permission_change`): admins grant and revoke anything
  (except an exception the role implies, above); a `manage_staff` holder
  who is not an admin acts on mechanics only, and only permissions they
  hold themselves, never `manage_staff`, never on their own row (42501).
- Role administration (D93): only an admin invites anyone as admin or
  manager (`create_staff`), changes anyone's role (`update_staff`, promote
  or demote) and changes an admin's or a manager's row (rename, deactivate,
  reactivate, exceptions). A non-admin `manage_staff` holder invites
  mechanics only and renames, deactivates and reactivates mechanics only
  (42501). Nobody changes their own role; the last active admin cannot be
  demoted or deactivated (55000, `staff_keep_an_active_admin`). Every role
  change appends one `role_changed` event (`{"role": {"from", "to"}}`) with
  its actor and an optional reason of at most 500 characters.
- Helpers in `private`, all `security definer`, `stable`, with
  `search_path = ''`:
  - `private.current_staff_id() returns uuid`
  - `private.is_staff() returns boolean`
  - `private.is_admin() returns boolean`
  - `private.has_permission(permission_key) returns boolean`: active, and
    `role_implies(role, permission)` or a `staff_permissions` row
  - `private.can_record_refunds() returns boolean` (D94)
  - `private.role_implies(staff_role, permission_key) returns boolean`
    (`immutable`, not a definer: a pure rule)
  - `private.current_customer_id() returns uuid`: the caller's
    non-archived `customers` row (Phase 1); null for anonymous callers,
    staff without a customers row and archived customers. EXECUTE for
    `authenticated` only.
  - `private.require_permission(permission_key)` raises
    `insufficient_privilege` when the caller lacks it. Every privileged RPC
    calls this first.

Customers are not staff. A person can be both (a mechanic who owns a bike) by
having a `staff` row and a `customers` row pointing at the same
`auth_user_id`.

Sign-in attempt counters (PLAN D72; migration
`20261005006000_sign_in_throttle.sql`): the Admin's own limits on `/login`,
because its Server Actions call Supabase Auth from the server, so Auth's
per-IP limits count the server's address for everyone.

```
private.sign_in_attempts               -- counters, not history
  bucket text not null                 -- 1-200 chars: "<request|verify>:<client|email>:<sha256 hex>"
  window_start timestamptz not null    -- fixed window, aligned to its length
  hits integer not null (> 0)
  PK (bucket, window_start), index (window_start)
```

- Written only by `public.note_sign_in_attempt(buckets text[],
  window_seconds integer) returns table (bucket_key text, hit_count
  integer)` (security definer, `search_path = ''`, EXECUTE for
  `service_role` only): adds one to each named bucket (named twice: once)
  in the current window with `insert ... on conflict do update`, so
  concurrent attempts are all counted, returns the counts and deletes
  counters older than a day. 1-8 buckets of 1-200 characters and a window
  of 60-3600 s, else 22023. RLS on, no policy, no grant to any API role:
  a caller who could name any bucket could fill someone else's.
- Keys hold SHA-256 digests of the client address (IPv6 per /64) and of
  the lower-cased email, never either in clear. The app
  (`src/lib/auth/sign-in-limits.ts`, `src/lib/admin/sign-in-throttle.ts`)
  builds them, holds the limits and decides.

## 2. Customers, bikes, attachments

  check: a `customer` entity's attachment is never `public` (PLAN D13),

attachment_events                       -- append-only; outlives deleted attachments
  id, attachment_id (no FK), entity_type, entity_id
  event_type attachment_event_type      -- created | visibility_changed | caption_changed | deleted
  actor_staff_id null, payload jsonb, reason (required for deleted), correlation_id, created_at
```

Rules:

- History over overwrites. Every owner change of a bike appends a
  `bike_ownership_events` row from a trigger, so no writer skips it; an
  owner change without a reason raises `reason_required` for every writer
  (RPCs pass the reason through the transaction-local
  `private.set_change_reason`). `authenticated` has no column grant on
  `bikes.customer_id` after insert: transfers go through
  `transfer_bike_ownership`. Archived customers receive no bikes
  (`customer_archived`); archived bikes are not transferred
  (`bike_archived`).
- Attachments are created only by `record_attachment`, which checks the
  object is in `storage.objects` at the canonical path (it reads the table
  as the function owner, which bypasses RLS on hosted Supabase and
  locally), moved only by `set_attachment_visibility`, deleted only by
  `delete_attachment` (reason required, the deleted row is kept in the
  `deleted` event's payload; ids are never reused). Staff may edit a
  caption directly (recorded as `caption_changed`).
- Entity types grow by phase. `private.attachment_entity_exists` knows
  `customer`, `bike` and (Phase 3) `work_order`, returns null for the rest (`record_attachment`
  raises `attachment_entity_unsupported`); the migration that creates
  `work_orders`, `products`, `inventory_units` or `consignment_items` adds
  its branch with `create or replace`.
- Search: `pg_trgm` lives in `extensions` (as on hosted Supabase). The
  generated search columns use built-in immutable functions only, so the
  trigram indexes need no helper function.

Attachment storage: two Supabase Storage buckets, created by migration
(`insert … on conflict do nothing`), photos only (JPEG, PNG, WebP,
HEIC/HEIF) up to 20 MiB. `media-internal` is private; staff read it directly
and customers get short-lived signed URLs minted on a server for
`visibility = customer` rows they are entitled to (`my_bike_attachments`).
`media-public` is a public bucket: its files are served to anyone at their
public URL (`/object/public/…`, which Storage serves without RLS), and it
holds only rows with `visibility = public`. Changing visibility to or from
`public` moves the object between buckets: the server copies it to the
other bucket (same path), calls `set_attachment_visibility` with the new
location (which must exist), then removes the old object. A photo recorded
without width and height is an original the device could not decode and
uploaded as is (it may carry EXIF GPS), so it is never public
(`attachment_original_never_public`), like any photo on a customer record.
Storage policies on `storage.objects`:

- `media-internal`: select and insert for active staff. Nobody else, ever:
  not anon, not signed-in customers, not inactive staff. Customer access is
  only through signed URLs.
- `media-public`: select and insert for active staff only. No select for
  anon or customers: public URLs need none, and a select policy would let
  anyone list the bucket.
- Both: no update policy (nothing is overwritten: uploads never upsert, a
  move copies to a new bucket). Delete for active staff only of objects no
  attachment row points at (`private.attachment_object_referenced`; those
  policies are in the attachments migration), so a recorded photo leaves
  Storage only through `delete_attachment` (reason, history) or a move.

Storage and Postgres share no transaction, so a Storage cleanup can fail
after the database change (the old copy after a move, a deleted photo's
file) or a change can stop half-way. The server says so (`cleanupPending`,
"Finish" in the viewer repeats the change), and every time it shows a
record it removes that record's stray objects:
`attachment_stray_objects(entity_type, entity_id)` lists objects under the
record's folder that no row points at and are older than 10 minutes (not
part of a move still running); in `media-internal` only those whose
attachment id has history, or older than a day (an upload whose
`record_attachment` may still come). So `media-public` converges on public
photos only, whatever failed.

Object path: `{entity_type}/{entity_id}/{attachment_id}.{ext}`. Upload flow
(ADR-001 A7): the server picks the attachment id, mints a signed upload URL
for that exact path as the signed-in staff member, the phone uploads to it,
the server calls `record_attachment`.

## 3. Shop hours and appointments

Phase 2 migrations: `…2700_appointment_enum_values` (work_order_event_type
`appointment_linked`), `…2800_schedule`, `…2900_appointments`,
`…3000_appointment_customer_access` (step 1), `…3100_appointment_check_in`
(check-in, the `work_orders.appointment_id` foreign key and link triggers,
the completion trigger, D36, D40; §4) and `…3200_appointment_reporting`
(the appointment counts, D41; §14). Decisions: PLAN D2, D35, D36–D42.

```

**Time zone.** The shop's time zone is fixed at Asia/Singapore in the MVP
(D35, SPEC §24): `private.shop_timezone()` reads `shop_settings.timezone`
(fallback 'Asia/Singapore') and `private.shop_currency()` reads
`default_currency` (fallback 'SGD'); no RPC edits either. Every shop-day
computation goes through `private.shop_day()` / `shop_today()` /
`shop_day_start()`; a local wall-clock instant is
`(day + t) at time zone private.shop_timezone()` and the local time of an
instant `(ts at time zone private.shop_timezone())::time`.

**Open hours and closures (D38).** `private.shop_hours_ranges(day)` is the
open stretches of one shop-local date: the custom-hours override covering
the date if there is one (it replaces every weekly interval), else the
active weekly intervals of that weekday, merged (adjacent intervals form one
stretch; `day + time '24:00'` is the next midnight). `closed` overrides are
`[starts_at, ends_at)` (whole days or part of one day) and beat custom
hours; `custom_hours` rows always span whole shop-local days
(`save_closure_override` builds them) and never overlap each other.

**The slot grid and capacity (D2, D38).** Capacity windows are
`intake_slot_minutes` long and aligned to shop-local midnight
(`private.appointment_windows`). An appointment takes its `capacity_units`
in every window it overlaps; cancelled and no-show appointments take
nothing. A booking must start on the grid, lie wholly inside one open
stretch of one shop-local date, overlap no closed override and fit every
window: `private.appointment_slot_problem(starts_at, ends_at, units,
exclude_id)` returns the first code that fails, in the order
`appointment_slot_misaligned`, `appointment_outside_hours`,
`appointment_closed`, `appointment_capacity_exceeded` (or null).
`private.capacity_for_window(window_start, window_end)` returns
`intake_capacity_units` today; it is the D2 EXTENSION POINT (a later
migration replaces it to derive capacity from mechanic hours, leave and
skills) and nothing else reads `intake_capacity_units` for capacity.
`private.available_slots_at(day, type_id, as_of, for_staff)` lists the grid
starts of `day` that pass, with `remaining_units` (the least free capacity
over the overlapped windows before the booking); staff keep slots that
have not ended, everyone else only starts within the notice and horizon of
public active types (D37). Settings changes never move, shrink or cancel an
appointment: `ends_at` and `capacity_units` are snapshots (D38).

**Status machine (D39).** booked → confirmed | arrived | checked_in |
cancelled | no_show; confirmed → arrived | checked_in | cancelled |
no_show; arrived → checked_in | cancelled; no_show → arrived; checked_in →
completed. cancelled and completed are final. The trigger
`appointments_enforce_rules` enforces it for every writer, stamps the
status's `*_at` (a writer may provide an earlier business stamp), requires
`private.change_reason()` to cancel (it becomes `cancellation_reason`;
`cancelled_via` defaults to staff) and keeps customer, type, times, units,
source and creator immutable (`appointment_immutable`); the bike changes
only before check-in and must be the customer's and not archived. Staff
mark confirmed / arrived / no_show (`mark_appointment_status`; no_show only
after the start; no_show → arrived only on its own shop-local date, with a
capacity re-check), cancel with `cancel_appointment`, check in through
step 2's `check_in_appointment` (D40); completed follows the work order
(D36).

**Locks and keys.** Lock order, followed by every path so nothing
deadlocks: (a) the `shop_settings` row — FOR SHARE by appointment writers
that read settings, FOR UPDATE by the admin configuration RPCs (which
serialises configuration changes); (b) the per-customer advisory lock
`pg_advisory_xact_lock(hashtextextended('bicii.appointments.customer.' ||
customer_id, 0))` (`private.appointment_lock_customer`; customer
self-booking only; Phase 11 reuses it); (c) the per-day advisory lock
`hashtextextended('bicii.appointments.' || local_day, 0)`
(`private.appointment_lock_day`) and/or the appointment row FOR UPDATE —
`mark_appointment_status` takes the row, then the day lock; booking never
locks an appointment row; (d) step 2's check-in then takes the work order,
customer and bike row locks through Phase 3's path: `check_in_appointment`
holds the appointment row FOR UPDATE, then the existing work order FOR
UPDATE (when linking one), then the customer and the bike FOR SHARE (the
order `private.create_work_order` uses). The D36 completion trigger runs
under the job's row lock and then updates its appointment, but only an
appointment that is already checked in, for which check-in never locks a
work order (it returns the existing link), so no cycle forms. Bookings of one day
therefore serialise, so two bookings for the last unit cannot both succeed.
Every booking is idempotent on its client-made id (same customer, type and
start → the original row, even after the type was deactivated; otherwise
`appointment_conflict`); closures and types are saved by client-made ids
with `is_new` insert-or-replay semantics (`closure_conflict`,
`appointment_type_conflict`). Walk-ins never create an appointment.

Future-proofing (tables designed now, created when needed, no code paths in
MVP): `staff_working_hours`, `staff_leave`, `staff_skills`,
`appointment_types.required_skill`. Nothing in the booking RPC assumes a
mechanic.

Status machine (D15, D16): `private.work_order_transition_rule(from, to)`
returns `allowed`, `reason_required` or null; `src/lib/workshop.ts`
(`transitionRule`) mirrors it and a database test compares all 121 pairs.

| From | Allowed | Reason required |
|---|---|---|
| received | diagnosing, awaiting_customer, awaiting_parts, ready_to_start, in_progress | cancelled |
| diagnosing | awaiting_customer, awaiting_parts, ready_to_start, in_progress | cancelled |
| awaiting_customer | diagnosing, awaiting_parts, ready_to_start, in_progress | cancelled |
| awaiting_parts | diagnosing, awaiting_customer, ready_to_start, in_progress | cancelled |
| ready_to_start | diagnosing, awaiting_customer, awaiting_parts, in_progress | cancelled |
| in_progress | diagnosing, awaiting_customer, awaiting_parts, paused, completed | cancelled |
| paused | diagnosing, awaiting_customer, awaiting_parts, in_progress, completed | cancelled |
| completed | ready_for_collection, collected | in_progress ("reopen") |
| ready_for_collection | collected | in_progress ("reopen") |
| collected, cancelled | — (final) | — |

The same status is not a transition: `set_work_order_status` returns the row
unchanged (a replay). Nothing returns to `received`. "Open" means before
completion (received … paused): only open jobs take or void lines (D15) or
can be cancelled (D16, and only with no live line). "Closed" means collected
or cancelled: assignments and the approval flag no longer change; details
and notes still may.

Stamps. `private.work_orders_enforce_rules` (BEFORE INSERT OR UPDATE, every
writer) derives them from `status_changed_at`, which it sets to
`clock_timestamp()` unless the writer moved it forward (backfills; moving it
back is 22023): entering `in_progress` sets `started_at` only if it is null
(never cleared); `completed` sets `completed_at`; `ready_for_collection`
sets `ready_for_collection_at`; `collected` sets `collected_at`;
`cancelled` sets `cancelled_at` and `cancellation_reason` (the reason).
A reopen (completed or ready_for_collection → in_progress) clears
`completed_at` and `ready_for_collection_at`. DEVIATION, owner to confirm
before Phase 5: reopen clears completion stamps, which deviates from
DATA-MODEL §4's original "stamps exactly once, never clearing an earlier
stamp" and moves D3 recognition to the final completion. Phase 4 returns
sold units to held_for_customer on reopen (whenever `completed_at` goes from
non-null to null every unit on a non-voided inventory line of the job goes
sold → held_for_customer; whenever `completed_at` goes from null to
non-null, including re-completion after a reopen, they go
held_for_customer → sold), with no stock movement (D6, D25). Phase 3 keeps
the reopen rule in `private.work_orders_enforce_rules` (BEFORE INSERT OR
UPDATE), commented as the Phase 4 extension point; Phase 4 resolved that
extension point with a separate trigger and left the function as it is:
`work_orders_sell_held_units`, SECURITY DEFINER, `AFTER UPDATE ON
work_orders FOR EACH ROW WHEN (old.completed_at is distinct from
new.completed_at)`. It has no column list on purpose: `completed_at` is set
and cleared by the BEFORE trigger and is never in an UPDATE's target list,
so an `UPDATE OF completed_at` trigger would never fire. Under the job lock
`set_work_order_status` already holds, it takes `private.lock_stock` per
product (ascending) and the units FOR UPDATE (ascending); on completion
(including re-completion) held_for_customer units become sold with
`sold_at = completed_at` (cause `job_completed`) and
`private.refresh_unique_publication` runs per product; on reopen it first locks the linked bikes of
those units FOR UPDATE (ascending, lock order step 4) and refuses with
`bike_with_customer` when a sold unit's bike now has a customer (D29: the
bike goes back to the shop first); otherwise sold units
with no sale line go back to held_for_customer, `sold_at` null (cause
`job_reopened`), with no movement and no publication change. Stamps never change without a status change, and `job_number`,
`customer_id`, `bike_id`, `currency`, `created_by`, `created_at` and
`checked_in_at` never change (`work_order_immutable`); `lead_mechanic_id`
may only become the active lead (so only the assignments trigger moves it).
`appointment_id` is linked at most once: it is set on insert
(`private.create_work_order`) or may go from null to a value exactly once on
update, and once set it never changes and is never cleared
(`work_order_immutable`, P3's rule in `work_orders_enforce_rules`, which
Phase 2 relies on and does not replace). Phase 2 (`…3100`, D40) adds the
foreign key, the partial unique index and three triggers: BEFORE INSERT OR
UPDATE OF appointment_id `work_orders_appointment_rules` (only when a value
is SET: the appointment must exist (P0002) and be `checked_in`
(`appointment_not_checked_in`) with the job's customer and bike
(`appointment_work_order_mismatch`), for every writer); AFTER INSERT OR
UPDATE OF appointment_id `work_orders_sync_appointment_link` (named to fire
after `work_orders_record_history`, so the job's `checked_in` comes first:
the appointment's `work_order_linked` event `{work_order_id, job_number,
created}` and the job's `appointment_linked` event `{appointment_id,
starts_at, appointment_type_name, created}`, both dated
`greatest(job.checked_in_at, appointment.checked_in_at)`, the check-in
instant; customers never see it, `my_work_order_timeline` whitelists event
types); and AFTER UPDATE OF status `work_orders_sync_appointment_completion`
(D36: when a linked job first reaches completed, ready_for_collection or
collected, a `checked_in` appointment becomes `completed` at the job's
`completed_at`, with the current staff member as actor; a reopen does not
reopen it, a cancelled job leaves it checked_in). `check_in_appointment`
(§16) creates the job through `private.create_work_order` or links an open,
unlinked job this way. An insert must be `received`
with no lead and no stamps; the customer and the bike must exist and not be
archived (`work_order_customer_archived`, `work_order_bike_archived`), and
the customer must own the bike or the bike must have no owner (D18,
`bike_owner_mismatch`). `completed_at` and `collected_at` are different
events and different timestamps (SPEC §23); reports use `completed_at` as
the job's recognition date (D3).

Timeline. Triggers write the events, so no writer skips them, through
`private.record_work_order_event(work_order_id, event_type, payload, at)`
(actor = `current_staff_id()`, `auth.uid()`, correlation from the request);
`created_at` is the row's own business timestamp, so backfills stay
consistent. One event per action:

| Event | When | Payload |
|---|---|---|
| `checked_in` | job inserted, at `checked_in_at` | `job_number, customer_id, bike_id, requested_work` |
| `status_changed` / `completed` / `ready_for_collection` / `collected` / `cancelled` / `reopened` | each status change, at `status_changed_at` (exactly one event, typed by the target; `reopened` for completed/ready → in_progress) | `from, to, note` (+ `started: true` when it stamped `started_at`) |
| `details_changed` | requested work or notes edited | `{field: {from, to}}` per changed field |
| `approval_flagged` | flag or note changed | `flagged, note` |
| `assignment_changed` | assignment inserted / closed, at `assigned_at` / `unassigned_at` | `action (assigned/unassigned), staff_id, role` |
| `note_added` / `diagnosis_added` | `add_work_order_note` | `note_id, body` (`note_id`, the client's key, unique: `work_order_events_note_id_key`) |
| `photo_added` / `photo_removed` | job attachment recorded (at its `created_at`) / deleted | `attachment_id, visibility` / `attachment_id, reason` |
| `line_added` / `line_voided` | line inserted (at `created_at`) / voided (at `voided_at`) | `line_id, line_type, description, quantity, unit_sale_price, sale_total, currency` / `line_id, description, quantity, sale_total, reason` |
| `stock_consumed` / `stock_reversed` | `add_inventory_line` / the `void_line` inventory branch (Phase 4) | `line_id, movement_id, product_id, product_short_id, inventory_unit_id, unit_short_id, location_id, location_name, quantity, on_hand_after` / `line_id, movement_id, reversal_of_id, product_short_id, unit_short_id, location_name, quantity, on_hand_after` |

Payloads never contain cost, yield, rate or Cult Commons values: every
staff member reads the timeline, with or without `view_costs` (a test walks
every key and value). DATA-MODEL originally said "status_changed plus the
specific event"; one event per status change is the as-built rule. Nothing
is written for no-ops (same status, unchanged details, an existing
assignment, a replayed check-in or line).

Assignments (D22): any active staff member assigns or unassigns anyone
active (`staff_inactive`) on a job that is not closed (`work_order_closed`).
A new lead closes the previous lead's row (they leave the job; not demoted);
switching someone's role closes their row and opens one in the new role.
The AFTER trigger keeps `work_orders.lead_mechanic_id` equal to the active
lead.

Photos (D19): `private.attachment_entity_exists` knows `work_order`. Photos
on a job are `internal` or `customer`, never `public`
(`attachment_work_order_never_public` from a trigger for
`record_attachment` and `set_attachment_visibility`; CHECK
`attachments_work_order_never_public` as the backstop).

Lock order. Every RPC that touches a work order and its lines locks the
`work_orders` row FOR UPDATE (`private.lock_work_order`, which raises P0002
when the job is absent and checks no status) before any of its line rows
FOR UPDATE, so concurrent calls on one job serialise in one order;
`private.require_open_work_order` takes the same lock and then refuses a job
that is not open (`work_order_locked`). The line triggers' FOR SHARE on the
job follows the same order for direct writers. Phase 4's
`add_inventory_line` and `void_line` replacement call
`private.lock_work_order`, then the replay lookup (so a replay after
completion returns the original), then `private.require_open_work_order`;
§7 extends the order to stock, units and products.

Customers (D17) never read these tables (staff-only RLS); they read their
own jobs through the `my_work_order*` RPCs (§15 "Customer job projection",
§16; migration `20261004001600_workshop_customer_access`). Staff find a job
by its number through `staff_search` (`work_order` kind, migration
`…1700_workshop_search`).

    inventory line names an item
  index (work_order_id, created_at), (source_service_id), (source_product_id),
    (consignment_item_id)
```

Consigned parts (Phase 6 step 1; the owner's D27 change, D44). A consigned
part's line snapshots `unit_direct_cost_snapshot` = the item's agreed amount
(+ a unique item's non-voided shop-borne charges, D4) and
`consignor_payout_snapshot` = the agreed amount, and names its
`consignment_item_id`; both new columns are immutable (`line_immutable`).
The BEFORE INSERT OR UPDATE trigger `work_order_line_items_consignment_rules`
(definer, every writer; Phase 3's `work_order_line_items_enforce_rules` is
not replaced) refuses a customer-owned source product or unit
(`ownership_not_saleable`), requires a consigned source to name its own item
and a payout (`line_consignment_mismatch`) and a shop-owned one to name
neither. `authenticated` may read `consignment_item_id`, never the payout.

The arithmetic lives in generated columns so no application code can produce
a different number (`src/lib/cult-commons.ts` copies it for previews only;
a shared fixture table runs through both). A line snapshots its economics
when it is added: the description (service name unless overridden), unit
sale price and cost (service defaults unless overridden, D14) and the Cult
Commons rate from `private.cult_commons_rate_at(clock_timestamp())` (the
non-cancelled row with the latest `effective_from` ≤ that time;
`cult_commons_rate_missing` if none). Editing, archiving or deactivating a
service, or scheduling a new rate, never changes an existing line. Lines are
listed by `created_at` (there is no `sort_order`).

Rates (D21): only admins schedule (`schedule_cult_commons_rate`, now or
later, `rate_backdated` otherwise) or cancel (`cancel_cult_commons_rate`,
only while `effective_from` is in the future, `cult_commons_rate_in_effect`
otherwise) a rate; for every writer the rows are append-only
(`cult_commons_rates_append_only`) except setting `cancelled_at`/
`cancelled_by` once on a rate that has not started.

Totals per work order: `work_order_totals` (security invoker: job, currency,
live `line_count`, `sale_total`) for every staff member;
`work_order_totals_staff` adds `cost_total`, `yield_total`,
`cult_commons_share` (Σ line shares, D1), `bicii_yield_after_cc =
yield_total − cult_commons_share` and `cost_pending_count` (live lines with
no cost entered, D14: while it is above 0 the cost-side figures count those
lines at 0 and are provisional; the job page says so, and later reports
must too); `work_order_line_items_staff` returns every line column. Both `_staff` views are security-barrier definer views
that return rows only when `private.has_permission('view_costs')`;
`authenticated` holds SELECT on `work_order_line_items` only for the sale
side (no unit cost, rate, cost, yield or Cult Commons columns; `cost_pending`
is granted, since it says only that a cost is missing) and on `services` for
every column except `default_direct_cost`. The security definer writers to
those two tables re-raise a check or not-null violation through
`private.raise_without_row` (§16): Postgres would otherwise put the whole
row, hidden columns included, in the error's DETAIL.

Cult Commons: `cult_commons_share = max(yield, 0) × rate` per line, where
`yield = sale − direct cost` and the consignor payout is direct cost.
Negative yield reports a loss and never produces a negative share, nor
offsets another line (D1).

Lines change only while the job is open (D15, `work_order_locked`), checked
by the BEFORE trigger for every writer (it locks the job `for share`), and
are voided with a reason (`void_line`); a job is not cancelled while it has
a live line (D16, `work_order_has_lines`, trigger
`private.work_orders_cancel_requires_no_lines`). That is the single
cancel-with-lines rule; it covers Phase 4's inventory lines too, so Phase 4
adds no separate parts rule or code. The line RPCs follow the lock order in
§4: the `work_orders` row FOR UPDATE (`private.lock_work_order`) before any
line row FOR UPDATE.

Deviations from this document's earlier draft, each for a reason:

- (a) Lines are immutable except voiding and have no `sort_order`; the
  earlier draft allowed `sort_order` and `description_snapshot` typo fixes.
  Void and re-add keeps the evidence and matches the Phase 4 stock ledger.
- (b) `add_service_line`, `add_manual_line`, `void_line` and the service
  RPCs return ids, not rows (§16 says RPCs return the affected row): rows
  carry cost columns, and an RPC result is not column-gated.
- (c) `work_orders` and `services` are written only through RPCs (§15's
  earlier "S" insert/update for work orders and "A / P(manage_inventory)"
  for services are stricter now).
- (d) The anonymous/customer services listing in §15 arrives with Phase 11
  through a separate customer-safe projection.
- (e) The Cult Commons base rate ships in the migration, not the seed.
- (f) A manual line added without a cost is stored with cost 0 and
  `cost_pending` (D14, owner to confirm), rather than a nullable cost, so
  the generated arithmetic stays one expression; it is corrected by voiding
  and re-adding it with the cost.

## 6. Catalog and inventory

Built in Phase 4 (`20261004001800_inventory.sql`). Money columns are
`money_amount`, quantities `integer`. Every table has RLS: staff read;
`manage_inventory` writes locations and products; customers and anonymous
visitors read nothing (the anonymous surface is `reporting.public_items`,
§11, built in `20261004002100_inventory_publication.sql`).

Unit status transitions (`private.unit_status_transition_allowed`,
mirrored in `src/lib/inventory.ts`; same-state pairs are false):

| From | To |
|---|---|
| available | reserved, held_for_customer, sold, returned_to_consignor, written_off |
| reserved | available, held_for_customer, sold |
| held_for_customer | available, sold |
| sold | available, held_for_customer (the latter only on a job reopen, D25) |
| written_off | available |
| returned_to_consignor | (none) |

History payloads are exact and never carry a cost (no cost column name or
value appears in any product, unit or work-order event, nor in any RPC
return). Product: `created {short_id, name, tracking_type,
publication_status}`, `details_changed {fields: [names]}` (names only),
`price_changed {from, to}`, `cost_changed {}`, `publication_changed {from,
to}`, `archived {}` / `unarchived {}`. Unit: `created {short_id,
product_id, location_id, status, ownership_type}`, `status_changed {from,
to}` merged with the event context (`{work_order_id, job_number, line_id}`
or `{work_order_id, job_number, cause: 'job_completed' | 'job_reopened'}`,
set through `private.set_event_context` and read by
`private.event_context()`), `moved {from_location_id, to_location_id}`,
`details_changed {fields}`, `price_changed {from, to}`, `cost_changed {}`,
`archived {}` / `unarchived {}`.

Cost gating uses Phase 3's mechanism: `authenticated` has no column grant on
`products.default_direct_cost`, `inventory_units.direct_cost` or
`inventory_movements.unit_cost_snapshot` (so `select *` fails; callers list
columns), and reads them through the definer `security_barrier` views
`product_costs`, `inventory_unit_costs` and `inventory_movement_costs`
(rows only for `view_costs`), which also give expected yield and expected
Cult Commons with exactly Phase 3's generated expression for quantity 1
(D1). `public.selling_prices` gives every active staff member the
effective selling price of each product (unit null) and unit. Direct API
writes of a cost column by a caller without `view_costs` are refused (42501)
whatever the value (an UPDATE naming the column is refused even when it
equals the stored cost, so the refusal is never an equality oracle on a
hidden cost) by two SECURITY INVOKER triggers, `products_cost_write_guard` and
`inventory_units_cost_write_guard` (invoker because inside a definer
function `current_user` is the owner; definer RPCs check `view_costs`
themselves). Definer writes to these tables re-raise check and not-null
violations without the row (`private.raise_without_row`).

Consigned stock (Phase 6 step 1, D45): consigned units are created only by
`create_consignment_item` (through `private.register_unit`), on dedicated
consignment-owned products. `private.selling_price` (replaced with the same
signature, attributes and grants) returns, for a unit with a consignment
item, `coalesce(item.asking_price, unit.sale_price, product.default_sale_price)`;
for a consignment-owned product with no unit given, the asking price of its
FIFO-head item (status `active` with `remaining_qty > 0` in
`reporting.consignment_item_position`, ordered by `received_at`, `short_id`)
coalesced with the product default; otherwise Phase 4's body unchanged.

Photos on stock (`product`, `inventory_unit`) are internal or public, never
customer (`attachment_stock_never_customer`, backstop CHECK
`attachments_stock_never_customer`; D13 extended, D19's pattern).

A shop bike linked to a unit that is available, reserved or
held_for_customer cannot be given to a customer or archived:
`bikes_guard_stock_link` (BEFORE UPDATE … WHEN customer_id or archived_at
changes) raises `bike_in_stock`. The other direction (D29): a unit whose
linked bike has a customer never goes back into stock; the reopen trigger
and `void_line` refuse with `bike_with_customer`, and
`private.assert_unit_consistent` is the backstop. `bikes.inventory_unit_id`
has its FK and a unique index; `private.register_unit` sets it.

`supplier_products` (Phase 7, §10): several suppliers per product, PK
(supplier_id, product_id), `supplier_sku`, `lead_days` 0..365, at most one
`preferred` per product (`supplier_products_one_preferred`), and the
supplier's `last_unit_cost` / `last_received_at`, written only by
`receive_purchase` (D63). `last_unit_cost` is a purchase cost (D60): no
column grant; read through `supplier_products_staff`. Links are written by
`set_supplier_product` / `remove_supplier_product` (manage_purchasing).

Quantity products print one QR (`P-...`) any number of times. Unique units
print their own (`U-...`). A bulk unit that becomes special is
`split_unit_from_stock` (Phase 4, D28; §16): a `stock_adjustment` of −1
on the source plus a new draft unique product and its available unit at
the same location, both carrying the source's default direct cost, and the
unit's +1 `stock_adjustment`; both movements have request_id = the new
unit id.

## 7. Inventory movement ledger

                      its Phase 6 twin private.record_linked_movement, or Phase 7's

  currency char(3) not null default 'SGD'  -- the product's
  reason text null                         -- non-blank, ≤ 500
  created_by uuid null -> staff, correlation_id text, created_at (clock_timestamp)
  check inventory_movements_unit_delta: inventory_unit_id is null or abs(quantity_delta) = 1
  check inventory_movements_reason_required: stock_adjustment/damaged need a reason
  check inventory_movements_reversal_shape: (type = reversal) = (reversal_of_id is not null)
  check inventory_movements_job_consumption_shape: job_consumption needs the job and line, delta < 0
  check inventory_movements_damaged_negative, inventory_movements_transfer_request
  check inventory_movements_purchase_received_has_receipt_line (Phase 7):
        movement_type <> 'purchase_received' or purchase_receipt_line_id is not null
```

`request_id` replaces the original `transfer_group_id`: it is each call's
idempotency key, generated by the client for that one call. No RPC reuses
another entity's id or another call's key as its request_id, except that
`create_unique_unit` and `split_unit_from_stock` use the client's new unit
id, which is created for that one call.

The partial unique indexes are the idempotency guarantees. Phases 6, 7 and
10 rely on these exact predicates:

| Index | Predicate |
|---|---|
| `inventory_movements_job_consumption_once` | unique (work_order_line_item_id) where movement_type = 'job_consumption' |
| `inventory_movements_sale_line_once` | unique (sale_line_id) where movement_type in ('retail_sale','online_sale') |
| `inventory_movements_receipt_line_once` | unique (purchase_receipt_line_id) where movement_type = 'purchase_received' |
| `inventory_movements_request_once` | unique (request_id, product_id, location_id) where request_id is not null |
| `inventory_movements_reversal_of_id_key` | unique (reversal_of_id) |
| `inventory_movements_restock_once` | unique (sale_line_id) where movement_type = 'return' and sale_line_id is not null (Phase 6 step 2: a sale line is restocked at most once) |

Phase 6 step 2 (`20261004003500_sales.sql`) gave `inventory_movements.sale_line_id`
and `inventory_units.sold_sale_line_id` their foreign keys to `sale_lines`
(`on delete restrict`); `inventory_movements_sale_line_once` is unchanged.

Plus btree indexes on (product_id, location_id, id), (inventory_unit_id,
id), work_order_id, work_order_line_item_id, created_by and (id desc).

Phase 7 added only the foreign key
`inventory_movements_purchase_receipt_line_id_fkey` (→
`purchase_receipt_lines`, on delete restrict) and the check
`inventory_movements_purchase_received_has_receipt_line`; uniqueness per
receipt line is Phase 4's `inventory_movements_receipt_line_once`, and no
second index was added. Movements keep record time in `created_at` (there
is no effective-date column): a `purchase_received` movement's reason
carries the delivery time in shop time (`'PO-000034 received 25 Sep 2026
10:42'`), and purchasing reports and the last-cost order use
`purchase_receipts.received_at` (D64 D-RECEIPT-TIME).

`inventory_movements_enforce_rules` (BEFORE INSERT) requires a unit for a
unique product and forbids one for a quantity product, checks the unit's
product, requires a reversal to undo exactly one non-reversal movement
(same product, unit, location, opposite delta; `movement_invalid`), and
fills created_by and correlation_id. UPDATE and DELETE raise
`movement_append_only` for every writer.

CONS-STOCK-MOVES (D50; Phase 6 step 1): `inventory_movements_consignment_rules`
(BEFORE INSERT, definer, every writer; it runs before
`inventory_movements_enforce_rules`). For a consignment-owned product only
these are allowed: `consignment_received` (+, item set), `consignment_returned`
(−, item set), `retail_sale` / `online_sale` (−, sale line and item set),
`return` (+, sale line set), `job_consumption` (−, item set, D44),
`transfer`, and a `reversal` of a `transfer` or `job_consumption` (a NULL
item is copied from the original, so Phase 4's unchanged `void_line`
reversal stays linked). A listed type with the wrong shape is
`movement_invalid`; anything else (adjustments, damage, purchase receipts,
`create_unique_unit`, `split_unit_from_stock`) is
`consignment_stock_adjust_blocked`. For every product, a set
`consignment_item_id` must name an item of the same product and unit, and
`consignment_received` / `consignment_returned` on a non-consigned product
is `movement_invalid`. So on-hand of a consigned product always equals the
consignors' remaining quantity. An AFTER INSERT trigger writes a
`stock_returned` item event for each `consignment_returned` movement.

CONS-ITEM-LOCATION (D54; the Phase 6 review): the same trigger copies a
unit's `consignment_item_id` onto a consigned unit's movement that has
none (a transfer, a restock), and then refuses any movement of a
consignment-owned product without an item (`movement_invalid`). So
`private.consignment_item_on_hand(item_id, location_id)` (stable, definer,
no grant) = Σ quantity_delta of the item's movements at that location is
each consignor's stock per location; summed over locations it equals the
item's `remaining_qty`, and at every location the items' on-hand sums to
the product's (`tests/db/consignment-locations.test.ts`). Phase 4's
`transfer_stock` is replaced in `003300_consignment` (same signature and
grants): a transfer of consigned quantity stock writes its two rows
through `private.record_linked_movement` naming one item, the oldest
active item (`received_at`, `short_id`) with the whole quantity at the
source location, else `consignment_quantity_unavailable` (one consignor's
stock at a time: `inventory_movements_request_once` allows one row per
request, product and location).

Stock on hand is `reporting.stock_levels` (§14): the sum of quantity_delta
per product and location. A cached `inventory_balances` table may be added
later as a projection; `reporting.stock_reconciliation` (Phase 9) compares
the two.

Unique-unit invariant, proved by the database: two DEFERRABLE INITIALLY
DEFERRED constraint triggers named `inventory_unit_ledger_consistent` (on
inventory_movements after insert of a unit row; on inventory_units after
insert or a change of status, location or bike) call
`private.assert_unit_consistent(unit_id)` at commit: while available or
reserved the unit's ledger nets to 1 at its own location and 0 elsewhere; in
every other status it nets to 0 at every location; a linked bike points
back and, while the unit is available, reserved or held_for_customer, has no
customer (D29). Otherwise `unit_ledger_inconsistent`. held_for_customer ↔ sold (job
completion and reopen, D25) needs no movement.

**Global lock order** (binding for Phase 4 and every later phase that
touches stock):

1. the work_orders row FOR UPDATE, always through `private.lock_work_order`
   (never FOR SHARE on a work order before FOR UPDATE in one transaction);
2. the work_order_line_items row FOR UPDATE;
3. `private.lock_stock(product_id)` (a transaction advisory lock); several
   products in ascending product_id;
4. the bikes row FOR UPDATE (`create_unique_unit`, before `register_unit`
   links the bike; `void_line` and the reopen branch of
   `work_orders_sell_held_units`, before the unit, for the D29 owner check);
   several bikes in ascending id;
5. the inventory_units row FOR UPDATE; several units in ascending id;
6. (Phase 6) the consignment_items row FOR UPDATE; several in ascending id;
7. the products row FOR UPDATE (only `private.refresh_unique_publication`,
   `set_publication_status`, which takes `lock_stock(product)` first, and
   `return_consignment_item`'s archive).

Phase 6 step 2 paths: `record_retail_sale` inserts its header (0), then
3 (every product on the sale, units' products read unlocked, ascending) →
5 (units, ascending) → 6 (the units' items, any named item and every
active item of each consigned quantity product, ascending) → 7
(`refresh_unique_publication` per unique product sold, ascending).
`restock_unit` takes 0b (a consigned unit's consignor FOR SHARE) → 3 → 4
(its bike) → 5 → 6 → 7; a job reopen (`work_orders_sell_held_units`, under
1) takes the consignors of its consigned lines FOR SHARE before 6, which
is safe because nothing holding a consignor lock waits on 1–5.
`record_settlement`
inserts its header (0), then the consignor FOR SHARE (0b) and its items
FOR UPDATE (6); `reverse_settlement` locks its settlement row, then the
consignor FOR SHARE; `record_sale_refund` locks only its sale row.
Archiving a consignor (a plain UPDATE of 0b) takes its items FOR SHARE
(6) in its trigger, so an in-flight sale, restock or completion finishes
first and the balance check sees it.

Phase 6 adds, outside and before this order: step 0, the request's own
idempotency lock (`create_consignment_item`'s
`pg_advisory_xact_lock(hashtextextended('bicii.consignment_item:' || item_id, 0))`;
step 2's sale and settlement header inserts), and step 0b, the `consignors`
row FOR SHARE (intake checks it is not archived; archiving is a plain UPDATE
that takes nothing else). A path that starts from an item reads its
immutable `product_id` and `inventory_unit_id` without a lock, then takes
3 → 5 → 6 and re-reads it (`private.lock_consignment_item`).

Every RPC takes its locks before its replay check and any other read;
functions that lock and then read stay VOLATILE.

Private extension points (security definer, no grants):

| Function | Contract |
|---|---|
| `private.record_movement(product, unit, location, delta, type, reason, unit_cost_snapshot, request_id, work_order_id, line_id, reversal_of_id)` | THE single insert path; currency from the product; refuses an inactive location except for a reversal |
| `private.record_linked_movement(…the same eleven…, sale_line_id, consignment_item_id)` | Phase 6's twin with exactly the same rules (P0002 for a missing product or location, `location_inactive` unless a reversal, check and not-null violations without the row) that also writes `sale_line_id` and `consignment_item_id`; `record_movement` is unchanged (the purchasing track added its own twin the same way). No grants |
| `private.record_receipt_movement(product, location, quantity, unit_cost_snapshot, purchase_receipt_line_id, reason)` | Phase 7: the purchase twin of `record_movement` (which has no receipt-line parameter and is left alone). Same rules: currency from the product, P0002 for a missing product or location, `location_inactive`, check/not-null violations re-raised without the row; movement_type `purchase_received`; Phase 6's D50 trigger refuses it on a consigned product (`consignment_stock_adjust_blocked`), and D62 keeps such products off every PO. Called only by `receive_purchase` |
| `private.register_unit(unit_id, product, location, ownership, serial, condition, sale_price, direct_cost, bike_id, consignment_item_id)` | THE single unit-creation path, plus the bike link; Phase 6 creates consigned units through it |
| `private.selling_price(product_id, unit_id)` | THE single selling-price source: unit.sale_price, else product.default_sale_price. Phase 6 step 1 replaced it (same signature, `language sql stable security definer`, grants re-stated) to return the consignment asking price (§6, D45); Phase 8 labels and Phase 10 Shopify use it unchanged. EXECUTE for authenticated and anon, because the cost views and `reporting.public_items` call it as the caller (`create or replace` keeps the grants) |
| `private.lock_stock(product_id)` | the per-product stock lock |
| `private.stock_on_hand(product_id, location_id)` | ledger on-hand |
| `private.refresh_unique_publication(product_id)` | public → sold when no unit is in stock and one is sold; sold → public when a unit is available again (skips requirements). Every path that makes a unit available calls it after the unit change: `void_line`, `create_unique_unit` (a new unit on a sold product), and `restock_unit` (Phase 6) |
| `private.publication_transition_allowed`, `private.unit_status_transition_allowed`, `private.publication_requirements_met` | the state machines and publication requirements |
| `private.set_event_context(jsonb)`, `private.event_context()` | transaction-local extra keys for unit history |

## 8. Sales (non-workshop revenue)

D14, D24, D26, D29, D44–D46, D48, D49, D53). Workshop revenue is recorded
on `work_order_line_items`. Everything else that sells stock
(over-the-counter, Shopify in Phase 10, a consigned bike sold in store) is
a `sale`:

  recorded_by (null for a Shopify refund), integration_event_id null -> integration_events,

```

Deviation from the original design (D46): `sale_lines.inventory_unit_id` is
not a plain `unique`. The partial unique index `sale_lines_unit_sells_once`
allows at most one live (not restocked) line per unit, so a unit is sold
again only after `restock_unit` marked its previous line restocked.

A unit line snapshots cost = `coalesce(unit.direct_cost,
product.default_direct_cost)` for shop stock, or the item's agreed amount
plus its live shop-borne charges for consigned stock (payout = the agreed
amount, D4/D44). A quantity line snapshots `product.default_direct_cost`, or
for consigned stock the agreed amount of the one item it draws from (the
named one, else the FIFO head whose remaining quantity covers it, D45). The
price defaults to `private.selling_price` (a consigned quantity line: its own
item's asking price, else the product default) and any staff member may
override it (D53). NULL price → `sale_price_required`; NULL cost →
`sale_cost_missing`. A retail sale never takes stock below zero
(`insufficient_stock`).

A refund is a financial fact (D7, D49). It does not touch stock or units;
reports do not net it (Phase 6, and Phase 10 for online refunds, D85). Putting a unique item back on the floor
is a separate staff action (`restock_unit`) that writes a `return` movement
linked to the sale line, marks the line restocked and flips the unit back to
`available`, with a reason.

```

`reporting.consignment_item_position` (security_invoker, granted to no API
role; read by definer functions) is the ONLY derivation of an item's
quantities and liability. Per item: `consignment_item_id, consignor_id,
product_id, inventory_unit_id, quantity, sold_qty, restocked_qty,
job_held_qty, job_sold_qty, returned_qty, remaining_qty, owed_qty,
liability, last_sale_at, last_returned_at, consignor_charges, shop_charges`.

- `job_held_qty` / `job_sold_qty`: Σ quantity of live job lines naming the
  item whose job has no `completed_at` / has one (D44).
- `returned_qty` = −Σ `quantity_delta` of the item's `consignment_returned`
  movements; `last_returned_at` their latest time.
- `sold_qty` = Σ quantity of the item's sale lines on sales that are not
  voided; `restocked_qty` = Σ of those with `restocked_at` (step 2 replaced
  the view body, same columns, same order).
- `remaining_qty = quantity − (sold_qty − restocked_qty) − job_held_qty −
  job_sold_qty − returned_qty`; `owed_qty = (sold_qty − restocked_qty) +
  job_sold_qty`.
- `liability = round(Σ quantity × consignor_payout_snapshot, 2)` over live,
  non-restocked sale lines and the job-sold lines; `last_sale_at` = the
  latest of those sales' `recognized_at` and those jobs' `completed_at`.
- `consignor_charges` / `shop_charges` = Σ non-voided charges by bearer.

Item status (`private.refresh_consignment_item_status(item_id)`, the caller
holding the item lock): `remaining_qty < 0` → `consignment_quantity_negative`
(an internal guard); `withdrawn` stays; `remaining_qty > 0 or job_held_qty >
0` → `active`; else `owed_qty > 0` → `sold` (`sold_at = last_sale_at`); else
`returned` (`returned_at = now()`, `return_reason = change_reason()`). It
updates only on a real change, so one `status_changed` event per change.

Consigned parts (D44): the item is sold, and its liability exists, exactly
while its line is live and the job has a `completed_at`. A reopen returns the
item to `active` and removes the liability until the job is completed again;
a repeated completion or a replay never adds a second liability, because
nothing is stored. A void on the open job writes Phase 4's linked reversal,
which the D50 trigger links to the item. A consigned part goes back to the
consignor by reopen + void + `return_consignment_item`, never by
`restock_unit`. A reopen of a job with a consigned part of an archived
consignor is refused (`consignor_archived`, D47: an archived consignor
keeps no stock with the shop and a balance of 0), as is a restock of a
consigned unit whose consignor is archived.

Bikes (D51): a unique intake may link a shop bike record (not archived, no
owner, not already a unit: `bike_archived`, `bike_has_owner`,
`bike_already_linked`); a consignor's own bike is first transferred to the
shop with `transfer_bike_ownership` and a reason. The link is two-way
(`private.register_unit`), is not transferred on sale and stays after a
return, so that bike record cannot be consigned again
([R-020](RISKS.md#r-020--a-bike-record-consigned-once-cannot-be-consigned-again)).

Photos (D52): `consignment_item` is an attachable entity
(`private.attachment_entity_exists` gained the branch); its photos are
internal only: trigger `attachments_consignment_item_internal_only` raises
`attachment_consignment_internal_only` for `customer` or `public`, and the
CHECK of the same name is the backstop. Listing photos go on the product or
unit.

Settlements (step 2, D47), all three append-only (`settlement_immutable`
for every writer):

```
consignment_settlements
  id uuid PK                               -- client-supplied: the idempotency key
  consignor_id -> consignors
  amount money_amount not null (> 0)       -- = Σ its allocations exactly
  currency char(3), paid_at timestamptz not null (never > now() + 5 min)
  reference text null (≤ 200), notes text null (≤ 2000)   -- trimmed
  request_fingerprint text null            -- never granted
  created_by, created_at

settlement_lines
  id uuid PK default gen_random_uuid(), settlement_id, consignment_item_id,
  amount_applied money_amount (> 0)
  override_reason text null (non-blank, ≤ 500)   -- required above max(outstanding, 0)
  unique (settlement_id, consignment_item_id)

consignment_settlement_reversals
  id uuid PK (client id), settlement_id uuid not null unique,
  reason text (1..500), created_by, created_at
```

The ledgers (security_invoker views, granted to no API role, read by the
definer RPCs; nothing below is stored):

- `reporting.consignor_item_ledger`: every column of
  `consignment_item_position`, the item's `short_id, status, received_at,
  sold_at, returned_at, return_reason, agreed_amount_owed, asking_price,
  currency`, and `owed = liability − consignor_charges`, `paid` = Σ
  `amount_applied` of settlements that are not reversed, `outstanding =
  owed − paid`, `last_settlement_at` (latest `paid_at` of those).
- `reporting.consignor_ledger`: per consignor `consignor_id, display_name,
  customer_id, archived_at, currency, items_total, active_items,
  awaiting_settlement_items` (outstanding > 0), `returned_items`,
  `sold_items` (status sold), Σ
  `liability, consignor_charges, owed, paid, outstanding`, `last_sale_at,
  last_settlement_at`; it equals the sum of its item rows.

Per D46: liability counts live, non-restocked consigned sale lines and live
consigned job lines of completed jobs; a restock removes a sale line's
liability, a reopen a job line's. Outstanding may go negative (money paid
stays paid): shown as "Overpaid $x (consignor owes the shop)", never
"credit", and cleared only by a later sale, by voiding a consignor charge or
by reversing a settlement. A refund alone does not change the liability
(D7). Selling an item does not create a settlement: liability and
settlement are separate facts. A settlement replay with the same
fingerprint returns it even after the outstanding changed. A consignor is
archived only with no active item and an outstanding of exactly 0.

```

**History.** Triggers write `purchase_order_events` through
`private.record_purchase_order_event` (actor `private.current_staff_id()`,
correlation `private.current_correlation_id()`): INSERT on a PO →
`created {supplier_id, expected_at}`; UPDATE → `details_changed
{field: {from, to}}` for supplier_id, expected_at, supplier_reference and
notes (nothing changed → no event), draft→submitted → `submitted`, any move
to cancelled → `cancelled` with the cancellation reason, any other status
change → `status_changed {from, to}`; changes to created_at, submitted_at or
received_at alone write nothing. Lines: `line_added {product_id,
quantity_ordered, unit_cost, expected_at}`, `line_changed {field: {from,
to}}` (quantity_ordered, unit_cost, expected_at, notes) with
`private.change_reason()`, `line_removed` with the deleted row and the
reason. `receive_purchase` writes `received` itself.

**Receiving** (`receive_purchase(purchase_order_id, idempotency_key, lines
jsonb, reference, received_at, notes)`), in this order:

1. `manage_purchasing`; nulls 22004; `lines` must be a JSON array of at most
   200 objects (22023); empty → `purchase_receipt_empty`.
2. Fast path: a receipt with this key on this PO whose lines match
   (`private.purchase_receipt_matches`: same element count, same set of
   (purchase_order_line_id, location_id) keys with the same quantities; a
   supplied `unit_cost_actual` must equal the stored cost, an omitted one
   matches on the rest; never the PO line's current cost) is returned and
   NOTHING is written. Any other receipt with the key →
   `purchase_receipt_key_reused`.
3. Lock the PO FOR UPDATE (P0002), then repeat step 2.
4. draft → `purchase_order_not_submitted`; received or cancelled →
   `purchase_order_closed` (D65).
5. Parse each element: quantity a whole number 1..100000
   (`purchase_receipt_quantity_invalid`); the line on this PO
   (`purchase_receipt_line_foreign`); cost 0..99999.99
   (`purchase_receipt_cost_invalid`), absent or null → the PO line's
   `unit_cost` (0 is valid); the location exists (P0002) and is active
   (`location_inactive`); a (line, location) pair once
   (`purchase_receipt_line_duplicate`; one line split across locations is
   fine). The product's active/archived state is not re-checked (the goods
   arrived; SPEC §23).
6. Over-receipt per PO line under the PO lock: received + this call ≤
   ordered, else `purchase_over_receipt` (DETAIL names the product and the
   ordered, received and attempted quantities); nothing is written.
7. `effective = coalesce(received_at, now())`: > now() + 5 min →
   `purchase_receipt_in_future`; < now() − 30 days → `purchase_receipt_too_old`;
   < the PO's submitted_at → `purchase_receipt_before_submission` (D64).
8. Insert the receipt; a `unique_violation` on the key (a concurrent call on
   another PO) gives step 2's answer.
9. `private.lock_stock(product)` for each product, ascending, before any
   receipt line or movement.
10. Receipt lines in input order, then one `purchase_received` movement per
    receipt line through `private.record_receipt_movement` (ordered by
    product, location, line_number): quantity, `unit_cost_snapshot =
    unit_cost_actual`, `purchase_receipt_line_id`, reason `'PO-000034
    received 25 Sep 2026 10:42'` (effective, in `private.shop_timezone()`).
    No stock check (receiving only adds).
11. Last cost (D5 as refined by D63): with the change reason `'Received on
    PO-000034 (delivery note DN-5531)'` set, for each product in ascending id
    the candidate is the cost of its highest line_number line in this
    receipt (0 included). `products.default_direct_cost` takes it when it
    differs and no receipt line of that product belongs to another receipt
    that is later by (received_at, created_at, id); Phase 4's
    `products_record_history` writes the `cost_changed` event with the
    reason. Then `supplier_products (po.supplier_id, product)` is upserted:
    `last_unit_cost` by the same rule restricted to that supplier's POs (a new
    link takes the candidate), `last_received_at = greatest(existing,
    effective)`, currency = the PO's. No snapshot (`work_order_line_items`,
    existing movements) is touched.
12. The `received` event `{reference, received_at, units, lines:
    [{purchase_order_line_id, product_id, quantity_received, location_id}]}`.
13. `private.refresh_purchase_order_status(po, effective)`: acts only on
    submitted / partially_received; every line received in full → `received`
    with `received_at = effective`; else any receipt → `partially_received`;
    else `submitted`. Its `status_changed` event therefore follows `received`.
14. Return the receipt. `purchase_receipt_by_key(key)` finds it after a lost
    response.

Interaction with Phase 4: the movement insert fires
`inventory_movements_enforce_rules` (fills created_by = the caller's staff
id and the correlation id; a quantity product never names a unit); the
products update fires `products_enforce_rules` and `products_record_history`;
`products_cost_write_guard` is SECURITY INVOKER and does not fire inside the
definer RPC (current_user is the owner), which is intended: the RPC's own
guard is manage_purchasing (D60). `inventory_movements_receipt_line_once` is
the ledger backstop for "one movement per receipt line".

**Global purchasing lock order** (extends §7's): (1) the purchase_orders row
FOR UPDATE; (2) that PO's lines, read or changed only under the PO lock;
(3) `private.lock_stock(product_id)` for every product a receipt touches,
ascending, before any receipt line or movement (§7 step 3); (4) products
rows, updated in ascending id (§7 step 6, the last inventory lock); (5)
supplier_products rows in ascending product id. `set_supplier_product`
holds no PO: it locks the products row FOR NO KEY UPDATE, then
supplier_products (4 then 5), which serialises concurrent preference changes
even before a link exists. Purchasing RPCs never lock work orders, bikes or
units.

**D60 D-PO-COSTS (cost gating).** `private.can_view_purchase_costs()` =
view_costs OR manage_purchasing (security definer, EXECUTE to authenticated
for policies and views). authenticated has no column grant on
`supplier_products.last_unit_cost`, `purchase_order_lines.unit_cost` /
`ordered_total` or `purchase_receipt_lines.unit_cost_actual` /
`received_total`; they are read through the definer, security_barrier views
`supplier_products_staff`, `purchase_order_lines_staff` (+ received_value),
`purchase_receipt_lines_staff` and `purchase_order_totals_staff` (ordered,
received and outstanding value; outstanding only while submitted or
partially received), each filtered by that function. `purchase_order_events`
rows are visible to staff who pass it (payloads carry costs). manage_purchasing
opens no Phase 3/4/5 cost, yield or financial surface.

**Currency (D62).** A PO's currency is `private.shop_currency()` at
creation; lines and receipt lines copy it; a line's product must have the
same currency (`purchase_currency_mismatch`). A PO orders quantity-tracked
(`purchase_line_unique_product`), shop-owned (`purchase_line_not_shop_owned`),
active, non-archived (`purchase_line_product_inactive`) products, once per
PO (`purchase_line_duplicate_product`). Since Phase 6 a product's ownership
can be `consignment` (D45); such products are never purchased: the PO line,
`create_purchase_order_from_low_stock` and `set_supplier_product` (no
supplier link on a non-shop-owned product, added at the Phase 7
integration) refuse them with `purchase_line_not_shop_owned`,
`purchase_cost_defaults` and `reorder_suggestions` leave them out
(`reorder_suggestions` joins `public.products` and keeps
`ownership_type = 'shop_owned'`, because `reporting.low_stock` keeps
consigned products too), and
Phase 6's D50 trigger would refuse a `purchase_received` movement on one
(`consignment_stock_adjust_blocked`). `tests/db/purchasing.test.ts`
("Phase 6's consigned stock is never purchased") proves it on the seeded
jerseys.

## 11. QR identity and publication

- Every product, inventory unit and bike has a `short_id`. The QR payload is
  the URL `{shop_settings.public_site_url}/q/{short_id}` and nothing else
  (D9, decided in Phase 8: [ADR-017](decisions/ADR-017-labels-and-qr-base.md)).
  - `private.qr_payload(short_id)` is the only payload source for
    printing and `private.label_content` (§12) the only source of label
    text. The payload is `rtrim(public_site_url, '/') || '/q/' ||
    short_id` (one slash before `q`, also under a path base such as
    `https://bicii.sg/shop`). There is NO fallback: a missing row, a null
    or a malformed address raises P0001 `public_site_url_invalid` and
    nothing prints until an admin sets it (Settings → Labels and printers,
    `/settings/labels`, through `update_shop_settings`). A short ID that is
    not `(PO|B|J|P|U|C|S)-` + 6 digits is 22023.
  - `shop_settings_public_site_url_check` was tightened by
    `20261004003800_labels.sql` to exactly the rule `qr_payload` applies:
    `public_site_url ~ '^https?://[^/?#[:space:]]+(/[^?#[:space:]]*)?$'`
    and at most 200 characters (http or https, a host, an optional path,
    no query, no fragment, no whitespace); the cases are
    `tests/fixtures/qr-bases.ts`, shared with the TypeScript validator
    (`isValidQrBase` / `QR_BASE_PATTERN` in `src/lib/ids.ts`,
    `tests/unit/qr-base.test.ts`). The column has no default.
  - The app side (Phase 8 step 2, `src/lib/qr.ts`, server only): the app
    never builds a payload for printing (the job carries the database's
    `qr_payload`). What it DISPLAYS comes from the same column:
    `getQrBase()` reads `shop_settings.public_site_url` (row 1) with the
    request's RLS client once per render and returns it without trailing
    slashes when `isValidQrBase`, else null, with no environment fallback;
    `qrUrl(shortId)` is `{base}/q/{shortId}` or null, shown as "QR address
    not set" (`QrLabelUrl`, `src/components/domain/qr-label-url.tsx`) on
    the product and unit pages. `NEXT_PUBLIC_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` is read only
    in `src/lib/env.ts` and `src/lib/qr.ts` (`tests/unit/qr-base-sources.test.ts`)
    and is only an extra accepted scan base: `scanBases()` =
    `mergeScanBases(database base, environment base)` (`src/lib/scan.ts`),
    so labels printed against it keep scanning.
  - Labels of published products and units resolve publicly: a unit's
    label is its U- ID, and `reporting.public_items` has a row per
    published unit (D57). A bike tag (B-) resolves to "not found"
    publicly. The staff panel "What the public sees" (`PublicPreviewPanel`
    in `src/components/domain/public-preview.tsx`, read by
    `publicPreview()` in `src/lib/domain/inventory.ts`) reads the same
    view, which returns identical rows to anon and to staff for the same
    short ID (tested in `tests/db/labels.test.ts`), so it is exactly what
    an anonymous scan gets. Phase 8 adds no anonymous function, no
    `public.public_item` (Phase 11 creates it) and no anon client.
- The public site route `/q/[shortId]` resolves the ID through
  `reporting.public_items` (built in Phase 4, `20261004002100_inventory_publication.sql`;
  below). Unknown or unpublished IDs are simply absent from it, so they
  404 identically and the URL space leaks nothing.
- `reporting.public_items` is the ONLY anonymous inventory surface (§15)
  and Phase 11's contract. A definer view `with (security_barrier)` that
  reads the staff-only tables as its owner and filters itself; SELECT for
  anon and authenticated. Columns, exactly and in this order: `kind`
  (`product` | `unit`), `short_id`, `slug` (the product's `public_slug`,
  also on unit rows), `name`, `description`, `brand`, `category` (the
  category's name), `condition` (null for products), `sale_price`,
  `currency`, `availability` (`available` | `sold_out` | `sold` |
  `unavailable`), `photos` (jsonb), `updated_at` (a unit row's is the later
  of the unit's and the product's). Never a cost, serial number, internal
  note, location, ownership, consignor or SKU.
  - Rows: products whose `publication_status` is `public` or `sold` and
    `archived_at` is null; units of such products that are not archived
    and not `written_off` or `returned_to_consignor`. A product archived
    after its sale (sold → archived) shows neither itself nor its units.
  - `sale_price` = `private.selling_price(product_id, null)` for a product
    row and `private.selling_price(product_id, unit_id)` for a unit row, so
    Phase 6's replacement (the consignment asking price) flows through.
    A view's functions run as the caller, so anon and authenticated have
    EXECUTE on `private.selling_price`; anon has no USAGE on `private`, so
    the view is its only way to it (meta test).
  - `availability`: a quantity product is `sold` if its publication is
    sold, else `available` when its ledger on-hand (all locations) is above
    zero, else `sold_out`; a unique product is `available` when any unit is
    available, else `sold` if its publication is sold, else `unavailable`
    (its units are on a job, reserved or written off); a unit is
    `available`, `sold`, or `unavailable` for any other status.
  - `photos`: an array of `{bucket, path, width, height, caption}` (from
    `storage_bucket`, `storage_path`, `width`, `height`, `caption`) built
    only from `visibility = 'public'` attachments. A product row has the
    product's photos, oldest first; a unit row has the unit's, then the
    product's, then its linked bike's, each oldest first, the bike's
    limited to those created before the earlier of `unit.sold_at` and the
    bike's first transfer to a customer at or after the unit's creation
    (`bike_ownership_events`; `infinity` when neither exists), so a photo
    taken after the bike passed to its buyer never appears, even if a later
    reopen and re-completion moved `sold_at` (D29).
- The Admin also answers `/q/{shortId}` for staff (Phase 4,
  `src/app/(staff)/q/[shortId]/page.tsx`), its only /q route: after
  `requireStaff()` it resolves the ID with `resolveShortId`
  (`src/lib/domain/scan.ts`; the prefix picks the table, read through RLS,
  archived records included) and redirects to the staff page
  (`hrefForRecord`: B → `/bikes/[id]`, J → `/jobs/[id]` by `job_number`,
  P → `/products/[id]`, U → `/units/[id]`); an unknown ID shows "No record
  with P-999999" with Scan again and Search. C- and S- (Phase 6) and PO-
  (Phase 7) return nothing until their phases extend `resolveShortId`;
  Phase 11 verifies every prefix resolves. Later phases extend that
  function, never add routes.
- The Admin scanner (`interpretScan`, `src/lib/scan.ts`) recognises the QR
  URL on every accepted public base (`scanBases()` in `src/lib/qr.ts`:
  the database QR base when usable, then the environment's
  `NEXT_PUBLIC_PUBLIC_SITE_URL`), a `/q/{shortId}` URL on the Admin's own origin,
  or a bare short ID in any case, and opens `/q/{shortId}`. Anything else
  is shown as "Not a BICII label" and never followed.
- Publication state machine on `products.publication_status` (D26,
  `private.publication_transition_allowed`, mirrored in
  `src/lib/inventory.ts`): draft → internal_only, archived; internal_only →
  public, archived; public → internal_only, sold, archived; sold → public,
  archived; archived → internal_only. `sold` is entered only by a sale path
  (job completion; Phases 6 and 10) and only for unique products; `sold →
  public` is the system restore of `private.refresh_unique_publication`,
  which skips the requirements so a void is never blocked. Any other entry
  into `public` needs a selling price (`private.selling_price`), at least
  one `public` photo on the product, a unit or a unit's bike, and for a
  unique product an available unit (`publication_requires_price`,
  `publication_requires_photo`, `publication_requires_available_unit`);
  the products trigger enforces it for every writer. A new product starts
  draft or internal_only (`publication_initial_invalid`). `public_slug` is
  assigned at the first publish (name slug + `-` + lower(short_id), 'item'
  when the name has no letters or digits) and never changes
  (`product_slug_immutable`), through unpublish, rename and republish.
  Inventory rows are never public by default. By hand, publication changes
  only through `set_publication_status` (§16; authenticated has no column
  grant on `publication_status`), which adds D26's manual rules: `sold` is
  never chosen by hand, and a sold product leaves `sold` by hand only for
  `archived` (`publication_sold_by_sale`); its accepted targets equal
  `manualPublicationTargets` in `src/lib/inventory.ts` for every state
  (tested). A public unique product whose units are all written off stays
  public (showing `unavailable`) until staff unpublish it.

## 12. Label printing

Built by `20261004003800_labels.sql` (Phase 8 step 1; decisions D9, D56–D59
in [ADR-017](decisions/ADR-017-labels-and-qr-base.md)). The TypeScript side
is Phase 8 step 2 (below, "The app side"); the record pages' Labels card
and the settings screens are steps 3–4; a hardware adapter is Phase 12.

Types: `label_kind` (`product`, `unit`, `bike`); `printer_adapter`
(`browser`, `pdf`, `network_raw`, `bluetooth`; the last two exist for
Phase 12 and `printer_profiles_adapter_available` keeps them unusable);
`print_status` (`queued`, `rendered`, `printed`, `failed`); domain
`label_mm` = `numeric(5,1)` without NaN (`label_mm_not_nan`).

```
label_templates
  id uuid PK, name text (btrim, 1..80, unique label_templates_name_key),
  kind label_kind (never changes: label_template_kind_immutable),
  width_mm label_mm (20..150), height_mm label_mm (15..150),
  layout jsonb (layout v1), is_default boolean, active boolean,
  created_by -> staff (set by the trigger), created_at, updated_at
  label_templates_default_is_active: not is_default or active
  label_templates_one_default_per_kind: unique (kind) where is_default

printer_profiles
  id uuid PK, name text (btrim, 1..80, unique printer_profiles_name_key),
  adapter printer_adapter (never changes: printer_profile_adapter_immutable;
    browser | pdf only: printer_profiles_adapter_available),
  config jsonb default '{}' (config v1), is_default, active,
  sort_order integer, created_by -> staff, created_at, updated_at
  printer_profiles_one_default: unique ((true)) where is_default
  (a profile carries no template)

print_jobs
  id uuid PK (the client's id: create_print_job's idempotency key)
  label_kind, product_id -> products, inventory_unit_id -> inventory_units,
  bike_id -> bikes (exactly the one matching label_kind:
    print_jobs_entity_matches_kind; on delete restrict)
  short_id, qr_payload, content jsonb (private.label_content at creation)
  quantity integer (1..500; at most 10 unless product: D56)
  printer_profile_id -> printer_profiles, profile_snapshot {name, adapter,
    config}, adapter
  label_template_id -> label_templates, template_snapshot {name, kind,
    width_mm, height_mm, layout}
  status print_status default 'queued', rendered_at, completed_at,
  error (exactly when failed; 1..500 characters), status_changed_by -> staff,
  reprint_of_id -> print_jobs, requested_by -> staff, correlation_id,
  created_at, updated_at
```

Every foreign key has an index; `print_jobs` also has `(created_at desc)`,
one `(entity, created_at desc)` index per typed key and a partial index of
open jobs (`status in ('queued', 'rendered')`).

**Layout v1** (`label_templates.layout`, snake_case jsonb), exactly these
keys: `version` (1), `qr_mm` (number), `padding_mm` (0.5..6),
`qr_position` (`left` | `right`), `fields` (1..6 distinct of `name`,
`price`, `short_id`, `sku`, `identity`, `serial_number`; must include
`short_id`: every label shows its human-readable short ID), `name_lines`
(integer 1..3), `text_mm` (1.8..6). Geometry: 10 ≤ `qr_mm` ≤
least(width, height) − 2 × `padding_mm`, and width − `qr_mm` − 3 ×
`padding_mm` ≥ 15 (the text column). `private.label_layout_problem(layout,
width_mm, height_mm)` returns null or one sentence about the first problem
(for example "The QR code does not fit: at most 36.0 mm on this label.");
it never raises on a malformed shape. The trigger raises P0001
`label_layout_invalid` with that sentence as DETAIL, for every writer. Field
order is free in the database; the template editor (`TemplateSheet`, step 3) uses the fixed
canonical order `name`, `identity`, `price`, `serial_number`, `short_id`,
`sku`. Cases: `tests/fixtures/label-layouts.ts` (shared with step 2's zod
schema).

**Config v1** (`printer_profiles.config`, browser and pdf): an object whose
only keys are `offset_x_mm` and `offset_y_mm`, each optional, a number in
[−5, 5]; `private.printer_config_problem(adapter, config)`; P0001
`printer_config_invalid`.

**Defaults.** One default template per kind and one default printer
profile, moved only by `set_default_label_template` /
`set_default_printer_profile` (admin; authenticated has no column grant on
`is_default`); the default cannot be switched off
(`label_template_default_required`, `printer_profile_default_required`).
Built-in rows, inserted by the migration because production needs them
(`on conflict (id) do nothing`), all 58 × 40 mm with layout
`{"version": 1, "qr_mm": 28, "padding_mm": 2, "qr_position": "left",
"name_lines": 2, "text_mm": 3, "fields": [...]}`:

| id | name | kind / adapter | fields / config | default |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `1ab00000-0000-4000-8000-000000000001` | Product 58 × 40 | product | name, price, short_id, sku | yes |
| `1ab00000-0000-4000-8000-000000000002` | Unit 58 × 40 | unit | name, identity, price, short_id | yes |
| `1ab00000-0000-4000-8000-000000000003` | Bike tag 58 × 40 | bike | name, identity, serial_number, short_id | yes |
| `a8000000-0000-4000-8000-000000000001` | This device (browser print) | browser | `{}`, sort 0 | yes |
| `a8000000-0000-4000-8000-000000000002` | PDF download | pdf | `{}`, sort 1 | no |

**Label text** (`private.label_content(kind, entity_id)`, the only source;
stable, security definer). Returns exactly `kind`, `short_id`,
`qr_payload` (`private.qr_payload`), `name`, `price`, `currency`, `sku`,
`identity` (a JSON array of lines, possibly empty) and `serial_number`;
strings trimmed, `name` at most 120 characters, each identity line at most
80, blank values dropped (null). P0002 for an unknown record; P0001
`label_entity_archived` for an archived product, an archived unit or a unit
whose product is archived, or an archived bike; P0001
`label_unique_product_needs_unit` for kind `product` on a unique product
(D57).

- product: `name` = `products.name` (the public view's expression);
  `price` = `selling_price(id, null)`; `currency` = `products.currency`;
  `sku`; `identity` = [brand] when the brand is set and not already in the
  name (case-insensitive), else []; `serial_number` null.
- unit: its product's `name`, `currency` and `sku`; `price` =
  `selling_price(product_id, unit_id)`; `serial_number` = the unit's, else
  its bike's; `identity` = the bike's "Size {frame_size} · {colour}" line
  when the unit is linked to a bike and either is set, then the first line
  of the unit's `condition` (which `public_items` exposes) when not blank.
- bike: `name` = brand, model, variant joined by single spaces, skipping
  blank parts (equal to `bikeTitle()` in `src/lib/bikes.ts` for every
  seeded bike, tested; a name over 120 characters is cut on a label but not
  by `bikeTitle`); `price` null; `currency` = `private.shop_currency()`;
  `sku` null; `identity` = the size/colour line; `serial_number` =
  `bikes.serial_number`.

**The label-text rule.** Label text is a subset of `reporting.public_items`'
fields (name, brand, price, currency, a unit's condition) plus identifiers
(short ID, SKU, a bike's size/colour line, serial number). Never a cost,
direct cost, yield, Cult Commons, consignor, ownership type, owner or
customer name, or internal note: `private.label_content` never reads those
columns (its source mentions none of `consignment_items`, `direct_cost`,
`ownership_type`, `internal_note`, tested), and `print_jobs_content_keys`
is the database whitelist of content keys (an extra key is 23514 for every
writer).

**The price (D58).** Exactly `private.selling_price(product_id,
inventory_unit_id)`, the function `reporting.public_items`, the in-store
sale default (`private.sell_line`), `add_inventory_line` and Shopify use;
never reproduced. Rendered with two decimals (`to_char(p,
'FM9999999999990.00')`); NULL → JSON null (no price line, never "0.00");
0 → "0.00" (D24 as amended: 0 is a known price). A consigned price reaches
the label only through that function.

**Snapshots.** `content`, `template_snapshot`, `profile_snapshot`,
`short_id` and `qr_payload` are written once by `create_print_job`; catalog,
template and printer edits never change a job (tested). Record pages warn
when the current price differs from the last printed label's (the Labels
card, step 3; only `printed` jobs count).

**Status machine (D59).** `private.print_job_transition_allowed`: queued →
rendered, printed, failed; rendered → printed, failed; printed and failed
are final; nothing returns to queued (cases:
`tests/fixtures/print-transitions.ts`). `rendered` is set when the labels
were sent for printing (the print view's Print or Open PDF, step 2), `printed`
or `failed` (with what went wrong) when staff confirm. Checks keep the
stamps consistent: `print_jobs_error_check` (error exactly when failed),
`print_jobs_completed_check` (completed_at exactly when printed or failed),
`print_jobs_rendered_check` (no rendered_at while queued). The trigger
`print_jobs_enforce_rules` lets only `status`, `rendered_at`,
`completed_at`, `error`, `status_changed_by` and `updated_at` change
(`print_job_immutable`) and only along the machine
(`print_job_transition_invalid`), for every writer; deleting a job is
`print_job_immutable` for every role. "Print again" is a new job with
`reprint_of_id` (same kind and record: `print_job_reprint_mismatch`).
Archived records keep their jobs readable (SPEC §23).

**The app side (Phase 8 step 2).**

- `src/lib/printing/` (pure, no Supabase): `types.ts` (camelCase DTOs:
  `LabelContent`, `LabelLayout`, `LabelTemplate`, `PrinterProfile`,
  `PrintJob`); `schemas.ts` (zod: `labelContentSchema` strict, so an
  unknown key such as `cost` fails before it can reach a label;
  `labelLayoutSchema`, `printerConfigSchema`; `labelLayoutProblem` mirrors
  `private.label_layout_problem` sentence for sentence and
  `labelTemplateInputSchema` applies it with the table's size checks,
  tested on `tests/fixtures/label-layouts.ts`); `compose.ts`
  (`composeLabel`, the ONE layout engine for SVG and PDF, from standard-font
  metrics in `metrics.ts`; a 0.00 price prints `$0.00`, a null price
  nothing; the short ID and price are never cut); `label-svg.tsx`;
  `document.ts` (`buildLabelDocument(job)`: the job's template, content and
  printer config snapshots only); `job.ts` (the status machine mirror,
  `isPrintable`, D56's `maxLabelQuantity`); `availability.ts`
  (`labelUnavailable` for the four "printing unavailable" codes);
  `links.ts`; `adapters/` (`browser` → `LabelSheet`, `pdf` → pdf-lib,
  server only; `network_raw` / `bluetooth` throw `AdapterUnavailableError`).
- `src/lib/domain/labels.ts` (server only): `getPrintJob` (the DTO, every
  jsonb parsed; `entityArchived` from the record and, for a unit, its
  product), `listPrintJobs` (all, open = queued + rendered, failed; a short
  ID matched exactly, else part of `content->>name`; newest first with a
  `(created_at, id)` cursor), `listJobsFor`, `getLabelContext` (never
  throws for the four unavailable codes, nor for `label_preview`'s P0002 on
  a record that does not exist, reason `not_found`; a unique product's P- label is
  refused without calling `label_preview`), `getReprintPreset`,
  `createPrintJob`, `setPrintJobStatus`, and the admin writes
  (`saveTemplate` / `saveProfile` with the client id, `setDefaultTemplate`,
  `setDefaultProfile`, `setPublicSiteUrl` through `update_shop_settings`).
- Rendering a job is allowed only while it is open (D59): the print view
  shows the controls and prints the sheet only for queued and rendered
  jobs, and `GET /api/labels/{id}/pdf` answers 409 for a printed or failed
  job. "Print again" is always a link to the record
  (`?print=1&qty={n}&reprint={id}`), which makes a new job.

## 13. Shopify integration

Inbound built in Phase 10 step 1 (`20261004003900_shopify_integration.sql`,
`20261004004000_shopify_order_processing.sql`; PLAN D80–D89, ADR-020);
the outbound product sync is step 2, the service layer step 3 (built:
`src/lib/integrations/shopify/`, no schema change), the screens step 4
(`src/lib/domain/shopify.ts` reads these tables and views through RLS and
writes only through the staff RPCs; no schema change). This replaces the first draft (bigint ids, a `dead` job status,
Shopify ids on the sync row): ids are uuids, a job a person must act on is
`needs_attention`, and Shopify product and variant ids live ONLY on
`products` (§6). Every Shopify id is stored as a gid
(`gid://shopify/<Kind>/<digits>`, `private.shopify_gid`, checked on every
column).

```

**Recording** (`record_shopify_webhook`, service role). A rejected
delivery is stored without its body and never queued (D88). A verified one
is inserted `on conflict (provider, external_event_id)`: a repeat only
counts the delivery. A new event is skipped at once (no job) when its topic
is not `orders/paid` or `refunds/create` (`topic_not_handled`), when it is
a test delivery and test orders are not accepted (`test_order`), or when it
is a POS order (`pos_order`, D89); otherwise it gets a queued
`shopify_event` job.

**Processing an order** (`process_shopify_order_paid`, through
`process_shopify_event`), one transaction:

1. Lock the event row; a processed, skipped or rejected event only closes
   its job and returns what it stored. Count the attempt.
2. Inside one plpgsql subtransaction: validate the REST payload
   (`shopify_payload_invalid` names the field); take the advisory lock
   'bicii.shopify.order:' ‖ order gid; if a sale with that
   `shopify_order_id` exists the outcome is `duplicate_order` (and the
   order's other open deliveries close the same way); if another
   `orders/paid` event of the order is `skipped` (dismissed, test or POS)
   the event is skipped / `earlier_delivery_skipped`: a dismissal is final
   for the order (D87), whatever the webhook id. Check the
   settings, the shop currency (D35) and the tax basis (D89). Map every
   line `variant_id → products.shopify_variant_id`; any unmapped or custom
   line is one `shopify_variant_unmapped`. Insert the sale header (lock
   order 0; `recognized_at` = the payload's `processed_at`, else the
   trigger time, else receipt, D80; the customer only through a linked
   `customers.shopify_customer_id`, D86), then `lock_stock` per product,
   the oldest available units of each unique product at the online location
   FOR UPDATE in id order (D81), their items and every active item of each
   consigned quantity product, and the on-hand of each quantity product
   (D82). Write the lines through `private.sell_line(sale, n, line,
   'online_sale')`, priced by `private.shopify_split_amount` so they sum to
   Shopify's discounted line totals (D80); refresh unique products'
   publication last (D26).
3. On success the event is `processed` (`sale_recorded`, `result` = the
   sale and its lines), its job `done`, the order's other `pending` or
   `failed` deliveries (another webhook id) `processed` / `duplicate_order`
   with the sale and their jobs `done`
   (`private.shopify_close_order_siblings`, id order, SKIP LOCKED), so the
   queue and Today keep no failure for a recorded order, and any refund
   job waiting for the order is queued now (D87). On failure nothing of step 2 survives: the
   event is `failed` with the code and a human message (`result` keeps the
   unmapped lines), and its job (created if none) is `needs_attention`, or
   `queued` with `private.integration_backoff` for a transient code
   (`shopify_unexpected_error`, `shopify_refund_order_unknown`,
   `shopify_settings_missing`) until `max_attempts`.

Event codes and their messages are stored on the event and its job (staff
read them): `shopify_variant_unmapped`, `shopify_unit_unavailable`,
`shopify_insufficient_stock`, `shopify_currency_mismatch`,
`shopify_tax_basis_unsupported`, `shopify_payload_invalid`,
`shopify_settings_missing`, `shopify_refund_order_unknown`,
`shopify_sale_refused` (a `sell_line` refusal, its detail quoted) and
`shopify_unexpected_error` (retried; SQLSTATE in `last_error_detail`).

**Processing a refund** (`process_shopify_refund`): the same lock, replay,
test and subtransaction pattern; the order's advisory lock, then the sale
FOR UPDATE. A known refund id (a `sale_refunds.shopify_refund_id`, or
another delivery of the same refund id that is `processed`) is
`duplicate_refund`; another delivery of the same refund id that is
`skipped` makes it skipped / `earlier_delivery_skipped` (a dismissal is
final, D87; matched on the stored payloads' refund id, so it holds until
the owner purges them, R-040). No sale: a skipped
`orders/paid` event of that order (dismissed, test or POS) makes it
`order_not_recorded`; otherwise `shopify_refund_order_unknown` (retried, and
queued again when the order is recorded). The amount (D85) is the
line-attributable refund (Σ `private.shopify_refund_line_amount` of the
refund lines, else Σ successful refund transactions), never above the
transactions or the sale's remaining total; 0 money is `no_money_refunded`,
0 allocated `refund_not_allocated`. One `sale_refunds` row (recorded_by
null, restocked false), the sale `refunded` or `partially_refunded` as
`record_sale_refund` decides; shipping, the excess and per-line details
stay in `result`. No movement, unit, item, line or settlement changes (D7).

Delivering a webhook ten times yields one event; processing it ten times
yields one sale and one movement per line (`inventory_movements_sale_line_once`).

**Staff side** (§16): `retry_integration_job`, `dismiss_integration_job`
(dismissing an order is final for it: unless a sale exists, its other
open deliveries and its waiting refunds close too), `link_shopify_variant`
(mapping only, D84) and `link_shopify_customer` (never by email; recorded
sales are never edited, D86), each with an `integration_audit_events` row.
The service layer (`src/lib/integrations/shopify/`, step 3) owns every
Shopify API call and is the only caller of the service-role RPCs:
`handleShopifyWebhook` calls `record_shopify_webhook`, the queue runners
call `claim_integration_jobs` (one job at a time; by id for the job an RPC
returned), `process_shopify_event`, `product_sync_state` and
`record_product_sync_result`. Nothing in a component or route handler
talks to Shopify directly.

**Outbound product sync** (step 2, `20261004004100_shopify_product_sync.sql`;
D81, D83, D84, D86, D87):

- **The online price** is `private.shopify_online_price(product_id)`:
  `private.selling_price` (D58) for the oldest (created_at, id) available,
  non-customer-owned, non-archived unit at the online location of a unique
  product (no unit when there is none), or for no unit for a quantity
  product (a consigned one's FIFO item asking price, D45, else the
  default). The publish check, `product_sync_state` and so Shopify read it;
  nothing reads `default_sale_price` for an online price. NULL is missing;
  0 is a price (D24 as amended).
- **Effectively online** (`private.shopify_effective_online`): Publish
  online on, product active, not archived, not customer-owned, and public,
  or a unique product whose publication is `sold` (pushed at quantity 0).
- **Publish online** (`set_publish_online`, manage_inventory) refuses an
  archived product (`shopify_product_archived`), a customer-owned one
  (`shopify_not_saleable`), one that is not public
  (`shopify_requires_public`) or without an online price
  (`shopify_price_missing`). It upserts the sync row (`publish_online`,
  `publish_changed_by/at`; never the handle) and queues the product; it
  returns the queued job's id so the app runs exactly that job (non-admins
  never read the queue). Unpublishing a product never pushed is
  `not_synced` and dismisses its queued job; a pushed one is queued to be
  drafted (BICII-created) or set to quantity 0 (external).
- **Queueing** (`private.enqueue_product_sync`): nothing unless the sync row
  is published, was pushed before (`last_pushed_at`), or has a push
  running; so a product only linked to a variant of a Shopify-made product
  is never pushed until staff publish it. Otherwise it dismisses the
  product's `needs_attention` sync jobs ("Superseded by a newer change"),
  inserts a queued `product_sync` job `on conflict do nothing` on the
  one-queued-per-product index, marks the row `pending` and returns the
  queued job's id.
- **What queues a product** (deferred constraint triggers, run at commit;
  `private.shopify_enqueue_product_change`): every `inventory_movements`
  insert; a change of `products` name, description, brand, SKU, default
  price, publication, active or archived; an `inventory_units` insert or a
  change of status, location, price, ownership or archived; a
  `consignment_items.asking_price` change (`update_consignment_terms`); a
  public product photo inserted, deleted or changing visibility or entity.
  `shopify_settings.online_location_id` changing queues every published or
  pushed product at once (an immediate trigger). The triggers are
  deferred, not the brief's statement-level trigger, because a sale writes
  its movements before `refresh_unique_publication` locks the product (lock
  order 7): an immediate trigger taking the sync row there would invert
  the order against a product edit or `set_publish_online` and deadlock.
  Inside one transaction the job appears at commit (tests:
  `set constraints all immediate`).
- **Sync now** (`request_product_sync`, manage_inventory): needs a published
  or pushed product (`shopify_not_published`); clears `desired_hash` so the
  next run pushes in full, and returns the queued job, due now.
- **The worker's input** (`product_sync_state`, service role): name,
  description, brand, SKU, the online price, `effective_online`, the
  available quantity at the online location floored at 0 (the ledger for a
  quantity product; available, non-customer-owned, non-archived units for a
  unique one), `unit_price_conflicts` (short IDs of those units whose own
  selling price differs from the online price: the worker refuses, D81),
  the public product photo paths oldest first, the handle
  (`bicii-<short id>` unless the origin is `external`), the Shopify ids,
  inventory item and location, the last hash and pushed quantity (the
  compare quantity, D83), and `orders_in_flight` (an orders/paid event
  received in the last 10 minutes that is pending, or failed with its job
  queued or running).
- **The worker's result** (`record_product_sync_result`, service role):
  `pushed` stores the Shopify product and variant ids on `products` when
  missing (reason "Created in Shopify by the BICII sync"; different ids, or
  a BICII-created Shopify product another product carries, →
  `shopify_ids_conflict`; a variant on another product →
  `products_shopify_variant_id_key`), origin `bicii` unless already
  `external`, the inventory item, the handle (BICII-created only), the
  pushed quantity, price, hash and API version, clears the errors, fills
  `shopify_settings.shopify_location_id` when missing and finishes the job;
  `unchanged` records the check and clears the errors. Both settle the
  status: `pending` when another sync is queued, `synced` when effectively
  online, `not_synced` when never pushed, else `unpublished`; and dismiss
  older `needs_attention` syncs ("Resolved by a later sync"). `deferred`
  (D83) re-queues the job two minutes out without consuming an attempt;
  `failed` (D87) sets `error` with the human message and re-queues with
  `private.integration_backoff` when retriable and attempts remain, else
  `needs_attention`. When another job is already queued for the product, a
  re-queue dismisses this job and pushes the queued one's next attempt out
  instead (one queued per product). `job_id` may be NULL; a job closed
  meanwhile is left closed; an unknown outcome is 22023.
- **Settings** (`set_shopify_settings`, admin): the only editor of the row
  and of `storefront_url` (https or NULL, trailing slashes trimmed);
  creates the row when absent; the online location must exist (P0002) and,
  when it changes, be active (`location_inactive`); changing
  `accept_test_orders` needs a reason (D89, `reason_required`); same values
  change nothing; one `settings_changed` audit row `{from, to}`.

Lock order (extends the consignment migration's header): `shopify_settings`
FOR UPDATE, when taken, before 7 (products); then 8, the `shopify_product_sync`
rows (ascending product id when several), then the product's
`integration_retry_queue` rows.

## 14. Reporting views (schema `reporting`)

All views are plain SQL over source tables. None are maintained by hand.

From Phase 4 the `reporting` schema is exposed to PostgREST
(`supabase/config.toml` `[api] schemas`, the devstack's `db-schemas`, type
generation with `--schema public,reporting`, RUNBOOK "Hosted Supabase"),
because `reporting.public_items` is the anonymous surface (§15).
`authenticated` has USAGE; `anon` has USAGE (never CREATE) for
`public_items` only, the one reporting view granted to it. The stock views
are security_invoker, so the base tables' staff-only RLS applies;
`public_items` is a definer view that filters itself (§11). `private` is
never exposed.

| View | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `financial_lines` | Built (Phase 5, D32 RECOGNITION). One row per recognised ENTRY, columns in this order: `entry_key` text ('wol:' ‖ line id, unique), `source` text, `entry_kind` text ('line'), `source_line_id` uuid, `document_id` uuid, `document_number` text, `channel` text, `recognized_at` timestamptz, `recognized_day` date (`private.shop_day`), `line_type` text, `service_id`, `product_id`, `inventory_unit_id`, `category_id` (the service's or product's), `ownership_type` text (inventory lines: the unit's, else the product's; null otherwise), `consignment_item_id` (the line's consigned item; work-order lines carry it since Phase 6 step 2, D44), `customer_id`, `bike_id`, `lead_mechanic_id`, `description` text, `quantity`, `unit_sale_price`, `unit_direct_cost`, `cult_commons_rate`, `sale_total`, `cost_total`, `yield_total`, `cult_commons_share`, `bicii_yield_after_cc` (all plain numeric), `is_loss` boolean (yield < 0), `currency` text, `cost_pending` boolean. Pinned vocabulary: `source` ∈ ('work_order','sale'); `channel` ∈ ('workshop','retail','online'); `document_id` = work_orders.id or sales.id; `document_number` = the J- job number or the S- sale number; `entry_kind` = 'line'. Recognition (D3 as modified by D15, refined by D32): every non-voided line of a job with a current `completed_at` (completed, ready for collection or collected; never open or cancelled), on the shop day of that `completed_at`. Lines are frozen once completed, so the only correction is a reopen, which removes the whole job from its earlier day until it is completed again (past days can change; no reversal entries for workshop lines). Amounts come only from the line's snapshots and generated columns; each entry's Cult Commons is the line's own share (≥ 0, D1), so no negative Cult Commons payment arises; `cost_pending` lines (D14) are recognised at cost 0 and flagged. Sale branch (Built, Phase 6 step 2, `…3700_consignment_reporting`): one entry per line of a sale whose status is not `voided`, `union all` with every column in this order: `entry_key` 'sl:' ‖ line id, `source` 'sale', `entry_kind` 'line', `source_line_id` the line, `document_id` / `document_number` the sale and its S- number, `channel` 'retail' (source retail) or 'online' (online_shopify), `recognized_at` the sale's `recognized_at` on `private.shop_day` of it, `line_type` 'inventory', `service_id` null, the line's `product_id` and `inventory_unit_id`, the product's `category_id`, `ownership_type` the unit's else the product's, the line's `consignment_item_id`, the sale's `customer_id`, `bike_id` and `lead_mechanic_id` null, the description, quantity, price, cost, rate and four totals from the line's snapshots, `bicii_yield_after_cc = yield_total − cult_commons_share`, `is_loss = yield_total < 0`, the currency, `cost_pending` false. Refunds are not subtracted and restocked lines stay (D49: netting and Cult Commons claw-back are Phase 9's refund-reporting row). A consigned entry's cost already includes the consignor payout (D44, D46). Phase 9 appends only genuinely new columns at the end, never synonyms. |
| `daily_summary` | Built (Phase 5). One row per shop day from the earliest activity day (check-in, recognised entry or movement; today when none) to `private.shop_today()`, zero-filled; columns fixed in this order: 1 `day`; 2–7 `jobs_checked_in`, `jobs_started`, `jobs_completed`, `jobs_ready_for_collection`, `jobs_collected`, `jobs_cancelled` (flows: jobs whose CURRENT stamp falls that day, D31); 8 `currency` (`private.shop_currency()`); 9 `lines_recognised`; 10–14 `gross_sales`, `cogs`, `yield_total`, `cult_commons_share` (Σ entry shares, D1), `bicii_yield_after_cc` (shop-currency `financial_lines` by `recognized_day`); 15 `loss_lines`, 16 `loss_total` (≤ 0); 17 `parts_consumed_qty`, 18 `parts_consumed_lines`, 19 `parts_returned_qty` (reversals of job consumptions); 20 `stock_adjustments`, 21 `significant_stock_adjustments` (D33); 22 `appointments_scheduled`, 23 `appointments_arrived`, 24 `appointments_no_show` (Built, Phase 2 `…3200`, D41: `appointment_daily`'s `booked`, `arrived` and `no_shows` of that day, 0 when none; the series also starts at the earliest appointment's shop day and still ends at `private.shop_today()`); 25 `consignment_sales` integer, 26 `consignment_sales_total` numeric, 27 `new_consignor_liability` numeric (Built, Phase 6 step 2, zero-filled: over that day's shop-currency `financial_lines` entries with a `consignment_item_id`, i.e. sale lines and completed jobs' lines that sold consigned stock: the number of distinct documents, Σ their `sale_total`, and Σ round(quantity × the source line's `consignor_payout_snapshot`, 2)). Retail sales reach the money columns 9–16 through `financial_lines`; the reconcile invariants hold (the day's money columns are its entries' sums). Integer counts and numeric money with explicit casts; Phase 9 appends new measures only after column 27. |
| `appointment_daily` | Built (Phase 2, D41 APPT-COUNTS). One row per shop day that has appointments, by SCHEDULED day (`private.shop_day(starts_at)`) and CURRENT status: `day`, `booked` (not cancelled), `expected` (booked or confirmed), `arrived` (arrived, checked_in or completed), `checked_in` (checked_in or completed), `no_shows`, `cancelled`, all integer. security_invoker, granted to no API role (it calls `private.shop_day`); read through `public.appointment_daily` (zero-filled) and daily_summary's columns 22–24. Phase 9's activity report reads it. |
| `work_order_activity` | Built (Phase 5). One row per job: `work_order_id`, `job_number`, `status` (enum), `customer_id`, `bike_id`, `lead_mechanic_id`, `appointment_id`, `currency` text; the CURRENT stamps `checked_in_at`, `started_at`, `completed_at`, `ready_for_collection_at`, `collected_at`, `cancelled_at` and their shop days `checked_in_day`, `started_day`, `completed_day`, `ready_day`, `collected_day`, `cancelled_day`; `is_open`; `is_overdue` (D20: open and `now() - checked_in_at > interval '7 days'`); `age_days` (open: today − check-in day; else completion or cancellation day − check-in day); `days_to_start`, `days_to_complete`; `days_awaiting_collection` (completed/ready: today − completion day; collected: collection day − completion day); `time_to_complete` interval. Integer days and intervals only. A reopened job's completion stamps are its latest ones (D15). |
| `operational_exceptions` | Built (Phase 5, D34). Columns in order: `kind`, `severity` ('danger' \| 'warning'), `entity_type` ('work_order', 'product', 'inventory_unit', 'work_order_line'), `entity_id`, `entity_label` (job number or P-/U- short ID), `subject_label` (customer · bike, or the product name, with the location for negative stock), `days`, `quantity`, `since`. Kinds: `overdue_job` (warning, which only orders it after danger rows: the UI shows Overdue in the danger tone, as everywhere else; exactly D20, 7 = `OVERDUE_AFTER_DAYS`, strictly more than 7 × 24 h), `uncollected_job` (warning; completed or ready, completed ≥ 7 shop days ago), `negative_stock` (danger; `stock_levels.on_hand < 0`, quantity = on-hand), `unit_hold_stale` (danger; a held_for_customer unit with no live inventory line on an open job; since = its last status change), `currency_mismatch` (danger; a would-be-recognised line not in the shop currency, excluded from totals). Kinds are text: Phase 6 (unit_state_mismatch, unsettled_consignment), Phase 9 (more kinds; columns `issue, short_id, title, detail, amount, currency` appended at the end) and Phase 10 (integration_failed) replace the view keeping these columns first. Built (Phase 10 step 1, `…4000_shopify_order_processing`): the view is replaced with this definition unchanged plus `union all` of `private.integration_exceptions()`, the extension point for integration rows (same nine columns): one `integration_failed` row (danger, `entity_type` 'integration_job', the job id, the event subject or the product's short ID, `subject_label` = the human message ≤ 300, days since the job was created) per `needs_attention` job, for admins only (D86; zero rows for anyone else, so `today_dashboard.exceptions_now` counts them for admins only). When Phase 9 appends `issue, short_id, title, detail, amount, currency` it must widen `private.integration_exceptions()` too ([R-043](RISKS.md#r-043--phase-9-must-widen-the-integration-exceptions-function)). |
| `work_order_totals` / `work_order_totals_staff` | Running totals per job; the staff variant includes cost and yield. |
| `stock_levels` | Built (Phase 4): on-hand (`sum(quantity_delta)`) and `last_movement_at` per product and location from the ledger. security_invoker, SELECT to authenticated (staff rows only through RLS). |
| `product_stock` | Built (Phase 4): every product with on-hand across locations (0 when none), available and held units, `negative_locations` (locations below zero) and `below_reorder` (quantity product, reorder point set, on_hand <= reorder_point). security_invoker. |
| `stock_reconciliation` | Ledger-derived vs cached balance when the cache exists. |
| `low_stock` | Built (Phase 4): active, non-archived quantity products AT OR BELOW their reorder point (`on_hand <= reorder_point`), or below zero in total or at any location regardless of reorder point (D23); `shortfall = coalesce(reorder_point, 0) - on_hand`, largest first. security_invoker. |
| `consignor_ledger` / `consignor_item_ledger` | Built (Phase 6 step 2, D46, D47): per consignor / per item liability, consignor charges, owed, paid (settlements not reversed), outstanding, counts and dates; derived, never stored; no API grant ([§9](#9-consignment)). |
| `purchase_order_progress` | Built (Phase 7). One row per PO line: `purchase_order_id`, `po_number`, `supplier_id`, `po_status`, `purchase_order_line_id`, `product_id`, `quantity_ordered`, `quantity_received` (sum of receipt lines, 0 when none), `quantity_outstanding` (ordered − received, ≥ 0, for draft/submitted/partially_received, else 0), `quantity_cancelled` (the same remainder when cancelled, D61), `expected_at` (the line's, else the PO's), `last_received_at` (latest receipt `received_at`), `is_overdue` (submitted/partially_received, outstanding > 0 and expected_at < `private.purchasing_shop_today()`). security_invoker, SELECT to authenticated, no cost column. `private.purchasing_shop_today()` is a security definer wrapper of Phase 5's `private.shop_today()` (EXECUTE to authenticated), not a competing calendar helper: authenticated has no EXECUTE on the Phase 5 helpers. |
| `product_on_order` | Built (Phase 7). Per product with something outstanding on submitted or partially received POs (never drafts, D66): `product_id`, `quantity_on_order`, `open_purchase_orders`, `next_expected_at`. security_invoker, SELECT to authenticated. |
| `low_stock` + `product_on_order` → `public.reorder_suggestions` | Built (Phase 7, D66 D-REORDER). Not a view: the staff RPC in §16 joins `low_stock` (the products, kept only when `products.ownership_type = 'shop_owned'`, D62), `product_on_order` (on order, submitted and partially received only) and `supplier_products`, and computes `private.suggested_reorder_quantity(reorder_point, on_hand, on_order)` = max(2 × reorder_point − on_hand − on_order, 0), NULLs as 0 (immutable SQL, no grant). No cost column. |
| `shopify_sync_status` | Built (Phase 10 step 2, D86). One row per product with a sync row: `product_id`, `short_id`, `name`, `tracking_type`, `publication_status`, `publish_online`, `shopify_origin`, `sync_status`, `last_pushed_at`, `last_pushed_quantity`, `last_error_code`, `last_error`, `shopify_product_id`, `shopify_variant_id`, and the open sync job (`open_job_id`, `open_job_status`, `open_job_next_attempt_at`: running, else queued, else needs_attention). security_invoker, SELECT to authenticated: active staff read the rows; the job columns are NULL for non-admins (the queue's RLS); customers and anon read nothing. |
| `public_items` | Built (Phase 4): the only thing anon can read about inventory, Phase 11's /q contract. Published (public or sold) products and their units with exactly `kind, short_id, slug, name, description, brand, category, condition, sale_price, currency, availability, photos, updated_at, buy_online_url`; price from `private.selling_price`; public photos only. `buy_online_url` (Phase 10 step 2, D84; the single Buy-online rule Phase 11 reads) = `shopify_settings.storefront_url ‖ '/products/' ‖ shopify_product_sync.shopify_handle`, only when the row's own `availability` is `available`, `publish_online`, `sync_status = 'synced'`, the origin is `bicii` with a handle, and the storefront is set, and the row is what Shopify sells (D81, D58): a unit row only when it is the unit an online order takes (the oldest available, non-customer-owned, non-archived unit at `online_location_id`, as `private.shopify_online_price`), a product row only when its `sale_price` is not distinct from the online price (for a unique product, `selling_price` of that unit); otherwise NULL (an external-origin product never has one). It exposes no Shopify id, sync state, cost or payload. Definer view (it reads the sync row and settings as its owner), security_barrier, SELECT for anon and authenticated. Rules in §11. |

Materialise `daily_summary` only if measured to be slow; refresh then runs
`after()` completion/sale mutations.

**Phase 5 reporting rules (PLAN D30–D35).**

- `financial_lines`, `daily_summary`, `work_order_activity` and
  `operational_exceptions` are security_invoker views that are granted to
  NO API role, although `reporting` is exposed (the explicit revoke is
  tested). The app reads them only through the §16 RPCs, plus Phase 4's
  granted `reporting.low_stock`.
- The RPCs select view columns BY NAME and pass the `daily_summary`
  placeholders through un-coalesced, so Phases 2 and 6 replace only the
  views (create or replace, same leading columns) and the RPC results
  follow.
- Shop days (D35): every day computation goes through
  `private.shop_day(ts)`, `private.shop_today()` and
  `private.shop_day_start(day)`, never `current_date` or `ts::date`. They
  read `private.shop_timezone()` ('Asia/Singapore') and totals use
  `private.shop_currency()` ('SGD'); Phase 2 replaces those two bodies with
  the same signatures to read `shop_settings` (timezone, default_currency)
  with these fallbacks. All five are `stable`, `language sql`, not
  definer, with no API grants. The TypeScript mirror is `SHOP_TIME_ZONE` /
  `shopDateKey` in `src/lib/dates.ts`.
- "Recognised once" needs no lock of its own: `set_work_order_status` takes
  the job FOR UPDATE (`private.lock_work_order`) before its same-status and
  transition checks, so concurrent completions serialise and a repeat
  returns the row unchanged with no event; `financial_lines` has one entry
  per live line of a job with a `completed_at`
  (`reporting-concurrency.test.ts`).
- Significant adjustment (D33) lives in one replaceable function,
  `private.is_significant_adjustment(movement_type, quantity_delta,
  is_unit, unit_cost)`: a `stock_adjustment` or `damaged` movement with
  |delta| ≥ 5, on a unique unit, or |delta| × unit cost ≥ 100.00 (unit
  cost = `unit_cost_snapshot`, else `products.default_direct_cost`, else 0).

## 15. Row-level security matrix

`S` = active staff (any), `P(x)` = active staff holding permission x (by
role or as an exception), `M` = the manager role, `A` = the admin role,
`C` = authenticated customer on own rows, `anon` = anonymous. RPC = only via
security-definer function. Blank = no access. Since the staff roles
(D90–D94), every `P(x)` other than `P(manage_staff)` is also satisfied by
`M` (D91), and every `P(x)` by `A`; rows below that matter for roles are
written out, e.g. `A, M or P(view_costs)`.

**Customer access pattern (Phase 1, binding for every later phase).** Staff
and signed-in customers share the `authenticated` role, so a column grant
cannot show `internal_notes` to staff and hide it from customers, and RLS
can only hide whole rows. Therefore "C own" never means a customer policy on
a base table. Base tables that hold anything staff-only (customers, bikes,
attachments, and later appointments, work orders, events, line items) have
RLS policies for active staff only (`private.is_staff()`); a customer
selecting them gets zero rows. Customers read and write through
`security definer` RPCs named `my_*` (or verbs on "my" data) that resolve
the caller with `private.current_customer_id()`, never accept a customer id
from the caller, and return an explicit list of customer-safe columns (a
named composite type or `returns table`). Asking for a record that is not
theirs returns nothing rather than an error. EXECUTE goes to `authenticated`
only; anonymous access is a separate, explicitly public projection
(`reporting.public_items`, public appointment types). Each such RPC is
listed in `tests/fixtures/api-surface.ts` and tested for: own rows only,
no staff-only column in the result keys, another customer's id returns
nothing, anon is refused (`customer-access.test.ts` is the template).

**Customer job projection (Phase 3, shown in Phase 11; PLAN D8, D17).**
The four `my_work_order*` RPCs follow the pattern above. Which jobs: those
where the caller is `work_orders.customer_id`, whoever owns the bike now (a
new owner does not see the previous owner's jobs; the previous owner keeps
theirs) and whether or not the bike was archived since; cancelled jobs are
hidden everywhere. What of them: a coarse `customer_job_status`
(`private.customer_job_status`: received/diagnosing/ready_to_start →
`received`, in_progress/paused → `in_progress`, the rest as they are,
cancelled → null), the bike's short ID and title, the check-in,
completion, ready and collection times, and the live lines' sale total;
lines show description, quantity, unit price and total only; the timeline
shows check-in, changes of the customer status and customer-visible photos
that still exist. Requested work, intake/internal/completion notes,
approval, assignments, actors, event payloads and every cost, yield, rate
or Cult Commons value are never returned. Job photos follow D17 (the job's
customer), not the bike-photo rule of D12.

Column-level gating of cost/yield for staff without `view_costs` is done with
views (`*_staff` views include the columns; base tables revoke `select` on
those columns from `authenticated` via column grants). Customers never read
`internal_notes`, costs, yield, consignor or Cult Commons data; this is tested
(see TESTING.md).

## 16. RPC catalogue (security definer, in `public`)

Read RPCs that some callers may run but not see every column of return
gated columns as NULL, never omitted and never an error (Phase 5's D30
reports; Phase 6's sale costs, `private.can_view_sale_costs()`, and
consignment money, `private.can_view_consignment_money()`, D48).

Each RPC begins with `private.require_permission(...)` or `private.is_staff()`
as appropriate, runs in a single transaction, locks the rows it mutates, and
returns the created/affected row (except where a row would carry cost columns
an RPC result cannot gate: the line and service RPCs return the id, §5
deviation (b)). Idempotent ones accept an idempotency key or rely on a unique
index and return the existing row on replay.

Business errors an RPC raises on purpose use SQLSTATE `P0001` with `MESSAGE`
set to a stable snake_case code (for example `staff_email_mismatch`) and
`DETAIL` set to an explanation. `src/lib/db-errors.ts` maps known codes to
user-facing messages; unknown codes become a generic error. Authorization
failures are `42501`, missing rows `P0002`, the last-admin guard `55000`.
Unique (`23505`) and check (`23514`) violations are mapped by constraint name.
A security definer function that writes a table with columns its callers
may not read (`services`, `work_order_line_items`) catches
`check_violation` and `not_null_violation` around the write and re-raises
them with `private.raise_without_row(sqlstate, constraint, table, schema,
column, message)`: same SQLSTATE, constraint and message, no DETAIL. The
DETAIL ("Failing row contains (…)") is built with the definer's privileges
and would print the hidden columns (costs) to any caller through PostgREST.

| RPC | Guard | Effects |
|---|---|---|
| `update_shop_settings(intake_slot_minutes = null, intake_capacity_units = null, booking_min_notice_minutes = null, booking_horizon_days = null, customer_max_active_bookings = null, customer_cancel_cutoff_minutes = null, public_site_url = null)` → `shop_settings` | A | Built (Phase 2). `shop_settings` FOR UPDATE; null keeps a field, `public_site_url` '' clears it; no time zone or currency parameter (D35); `shop_capacity_below_type` when an active type takes more units; checks 23514 by name; unchanged → the row, no event. Never moves appointments (D38). |
| `set_shop_hours(weekday smallint, intervals jsonb, active = true)` → `setof shop_hours` | A | Built (Phase 2). Replaces one weekday's rows atomically from a JSON array of 0..4 `{"opens_at","closes_at"}` ("HH:MM", closes_at up to "24:00"); weekday outside 0..6 or malformed JSON → 22023; an inverted interval → 23514 `shop_hours_interval_check`; overlaps → `shop_hours_overlap`; the same intervals and flag → the existing rows, no events. |
| `save_closure_override(closure_id, is_new, kind closure_kind, first_day date, last_day date, reason, from_time time = null, to_time time = null)` → `closure_overrides` | A | Built (Phase 2, D38). closed without times: whole days; closed with both times: part of one day; custom_hours: times required, whole days. `closure_invalid_range` (last before first, over 366 days, one time only, times on several days, start not before end), `reason_required`, 23514 `closure_overrides_reason_check` (> 200), `closure_custom_hours_overlap` (exclusion constraint as backstop, 23P01). is_new: insert, identical row → replay (no event), different row → `closure_conflict`; not is_new: P0002 when missing, else update (no event when unchanged). |
| `delete_closure_override(closure_id, reason)` → `closure_overrides` | A | Built (Phase 2). `reason_required` / `reason_too_long` first; deletes and returns the row (its `deleted` schedule event keeps the row and the reason); null when already gone. |
| `save_appointment_type(appointment_type_id, is_new, name, description, duration_minutes, capacity_units, public, active, sort_order = 0)` → `appointment_types` | A | Built (Phase 2). Same insert-or-replay semantics (`appointment_type_conflict`, P0002); an active type above the intake capacity → `appointment_type_capacity_too_large`; 23505 `appointment_types_name_key` (ignoring case); existing appointments keep their snapshot (D38). |
| `public_appointment_types()` → `id, name, description, duration_minutes` | everyone (anon, authenticated) | Built (Phase 2). Active and public types by sort_order, name; never capacity units. |

| `available_slots(day date, appointment_type_id uuid)` → `slot_start, slot_end, remaining_units` | everyone (D37; Phase 11 must not revoke anon) | Built (Phase 2). `private.available_slots_at(day, type, now(), private.is_staff())`; `remaining_units` NULL for non-staff; null arguments → 22004. Phase 11's `bookable_slots` range wrapper calls `private.available_slots_at`. |
| `book_appointment(appointment_id, customer_id, appointment_type_id, starts_at timestamptz, bike_id = null, customer_note = null, internal_note = null)` → `appointments` | S | Built (Phase 2). `private.book_appointment_core(…, 'staff')`, in order: 22004 on nulls; `shop_settings` FOR SHARE; the day lock; replay by id (same customer, type and start → the row, no event; else `appointment_conflict`); P0002 / `appointment_type_unavailable` (inactive); P0002 / `customer_archived`; bike P0002 / `appointment_bike_archived` / `appointment_bike_not_owned`; `appointment_in_past` (ends_at ≤ now); `private.appointment_slot_problem` (misaligned, outside hours, closed, capacity); insert with the snapshots. |
| `mark_appointment_status(appointment_id, status, reason = null)` → `appointments` | S | Built (Phase 2, D39). `shop_settings` FOR SHARE, the row FOR UPDATE (P0002); targets confirmed / arrived / no_show only (`appointment_use_check_in`, `appointment_use_cancel`, `appointment_transition_invalid` for booked/completed); same status → replay; `appointment_transition_invalid`; `appointment_not_started`; no_show → arrived only on its own shop-local date, then the day lock and `appointment_capacity_exceeded`. One event with the optional reason. |
| `cancel_appointment(appointment_id, reason)` → `appointments` | S | Built (Phase 2). `reason_required` / `reason_too_long` first; the row FOR UPDATE (P0002); already cancelled → the row (no event); only booked, confirmed or arrived (`appointment_transition_invalid`); `cancelled_via` = staff. |
| `update_appointment(appointment_id, bike_id = null, clear_bike = false, customer_note = null, internal_note = null)` → `appointments` | S | Built (Phase 2). The row FOR UPDATE (P0002); null keeps, '' clears a note, `clear_bike` removes the bike; bike rules from the trigger (before check-in, the customer's, not archived); the customer's note only while not cancelled/completed/no_show (`appointment_immutable`); unchanged → no update, no event; one `details_changed` event otherwise. |
| `my_appointments(include_past = false)` → `setof my_appointment` | authenticated (C) | Built (Phase 2, D42; consumed by Phase 11). The caller's appointments not yet over, soonest first; `include_past` adds the past ones after them, latest first. Bike fields only while the bike is still theirs and not archived (D12). |
| `book_my_appointment(appointment_id, appointment_type_id, starts_at, bike_id = null, customer_note = null)` → `my_appointment` | C (42501 otherwise) | Built (Phase 2, D37). The booking core with the caller's customer id and source customer: active public types, `appointment_too_soon`, `appointment_too_far_ahead`, `appointment_customer_limit` (per-customer lock), then hours, closures, capacity; a bike that is not theirs (or unknown) → `appointment_bike_not_owned` with nothing about the bike. |
| `cancel_my_appointment(appointment_id, reason = null)` → `my_appointment` | C (42501 otherwise) | Built (Phase 2, D37). `reason_too_long`; `shop_settings` FOR SHARE; the caller's row FOR UPDATE, else NULL (no error); already cancelled → it (no event); booked/confirmed before `customer_cancel_cutoff_minutes` ahead of the start, else `appointment_not_cancellable`; reason defaults to 'Cancelled by the customer'; `cancelled_via` = customer. |

In order: 22004 on null ids; the appointment FOR UPDATE (P0002); checked_in or completed → its existing link with `created` false, whatever `work_order_id` was passed (replay, second device); not booked/confirmed/arrived → `appointment_transition_invalid`; `link_existing`: that job FOR UPDATE (P0002), same customer and bike, open (`private.work_order_status_is_open`) and unlinked, else `appointment_work_order_mismatch`; customer then bike FOR SHARE; bike P0002 / `appointment_bike_archived` / `appointment_bike_not_owned` (shop bikes too); the appointment → bike set, `checked_in` (stamps checked_in_at, arrived_at). New job: `private.create_work_order(actor, work_order_id, customer, bike, coalesce(nullif(btrim(requested_work), ''), customer_note), intake_notes, lead_mechanic_id, '{}', '[]', appointment_id)` (job number, `checked_in` event, D18, lead as for a walk-in; blank work and no note → `requested_work_required`), then `work_order_conflict` unless the returned job carries this appointment (an older job under that id). Existing job: `appointment_id` null → this appointment. Both link events from the triggers (§4). One transaction; `created` = not `link_existing`. |
| `appointment_daily(from_day date = null, to_day date = null)` → `day, booked, expected, arrived, checked_in, no_shows, cancelled` | S | Built (Phase 2, D41). Operational counts, no permission needed (D30). `reporting.appointment_daily` zero-filled one row per day; daily_summary's range rules (null bound = the other, both null = today, ≤ 366 days, else `report_range_invalid`); future days allowed (upcoming appointments). |
| `create_work_order(work_order_id, customer_id, bike_id, requested_work, intake_notes = null, lead_mechanic_id = null, additional_staff_ids uuid[] = '{}', services jsonb = '[]')` → `work_orders` | S | Calls `private.create_work_order(actor, …, appointment_id)`. Replay first: an existing id returns the row as it is now when customer and bike match (no check, assignment or line re-run, no number burned), else `work_order_conflict`. Then FOR SHARE on customer and bike (D18 against a concurrent transfer), insert (trigger: J- number, `work_order_customer_archived`, `work_order_bike_archived`, `bike_owner_mismatch`), lead, ≤ 10 distinct additional staff, ≤ 20 services `{line_id, service_id, quantity}` (malformed 22023) through `private.insert_service_line`. One transaction. `requested_work_required`; 22004 for missing ids. |
| `set_work_order_status(work_order_id, status, note = null)` → `work_orders` | S | Locks the job; same status → row unchanged (no event); `work_order_transition_invalid`; `reason_required` for cancel/reopen; `work_order_has_lines` when cancelling with live lines. Triggers stamp the time and write one event. |
| `update_work_order(work_order_id, requested_work = null, intake_notes = null, internal_notes = null, completion_notes = null)` → `work_orders` | S | Null keeps, '' clears (requested work cannot be cleared: `requested_work_required`); no-op when unchanged; one `details_changed` event. Any status. |
| `add_work_order_note(note_id, work_order_id, kind work_order_note_kind, body)` → `work_order_events` | S | Locks the job; replay by `note_id` first (same job → that event; else `note_conflict`); `note_added` / `diagnosis_added` with `{note_id, body}` (1..5000; `note_required`, `note_too_long`). Any status. |
| `set_approval_flag(work_order_id, flagged, note = null)` → `work_orders` | S | Internal flag (SPEC §7.1); note null keeps the stored one, '' clears it; `work_order_closed`; replay no-op; `approval_flagged` event. |
| `assign_staff(work_order_id, staff_id, role assignment_role = 'additional')` → `work_order_assignments` | S (D22) | Locks the job; `work_order_closed`; P0002 / `staff_inactive`; same role → the active row (no event); other role → close and reopen; a new lead closes the previous lead's row. Trigger syncs `lead_mechanic_id`, writes `assignment_changed`. |
| `unassign_staff(work_order_id, staff_id)` → `work_order_assignments` | S | Closes the active row and returns it; null when none (no event). `work_order_closed`. |
| `add_service_line(line_id, work_order_id, service_id, quantity line_quantity = 1, unit_sale_price = null, unit_direct_cost = null, description = null)` → `uuid` | S; a cost needs P(view_costs) (D14) | Locks the job, then `private.insert_service_line`: replay by line id first (same job, type and service → id; else `line_conflict`), then `work_order_locked`, P0002 / `service_unavailable`, snapshots (description, price, cost, `cult_commons_rate_at(now)`), insert. Returns the id only. |
| `add_manual_line(line_id, work_order_id, description, unit_sale_price, quantity line_quantity = 1, unit_direct_cost = null)` → `uuid` | S; a cost needs P(view_costs) (D14) | Same order (replay, `work_order_locked`); cost null → 0 with `cost_pending` (D14). Returns the id only. |
| `void_line(line_id, reason)` → `uuid` | S | `reason_required` / `reason_too_long`; locks the job, then the line; already voided → id (no event); `work_order_locked`. Sets `voided_*`; never deletes. Phase 4 replaced it (same signature, order and wrapper) with the inventory branch below. |
| `work_order_timeline(work_order_id, max_rows = 200)` | S | Events newest first with actor and (assignment events) subject display names; 1..2000 rows (the job page asks one more than it shows, to say older events exist). |
| `create_service(service_id, name, default_sale_price, description = null, category_id = null, default_direct_cost = null, is_active = true, is_public = false)` → `uuid` | P(manage_inventory); a cost needs P(view_costs) | Replay by id with the same name → id; else `service_conflict`; `category_kind_mismatch`; 23505 `services_active_name_key`. |
| `update_service(service_id, name, default_sale_price, description = null, category_id = null, is_active = true, is_public = false, default_direct_cost = null)` → `uuid` | same | Replaces every field; cost null keeps it. P0002. |

| `schedule_cult_commons_rate(rate_id, rate, effective_from = null)` → `cult_commons_rates` | A | Replay by `rate_id` first (same rate → the row as it is now; else `rate_conflict`). Null = now; earlier than now → `rate_backdated` (D21); 23505 on a taken start time. |
| `cancel_cult_commons_rate(rate_id)` → `cult_commons_rates` | A | Only before it starts (`cult_commons_rate_in_effect`); replay returns the row. |
| `add_inventory_line(line_id, work_order_id, product_id, quantity integer = 1, location_id = null, inventory_unit_id = null, unit_sale_price money_amount = null)` → `inventory_line_result (line_id, movement_id, location_id, on_hand_after, replayed)` | S | Built (Phase 4); replaced in Phase 6 step 1 (`…003400`, same signature, return type, guard and step order) for the owner's D27 change (D44): only a customer-owned product or unit is `ownership_not_saleable`. A consigned unit: its item FOR UPDATE after the unit (lock order 6), `consignment_item_not_active`, cost = agreed + shop charges, payout = agreed, price default = `private.selling_price`. A consigned quantity product: its active items FOR UPDATE in id order, then the FIFO item (`received_at`, `short_id`) whose `remaining_qty` covers the part (`consignment_quantity_unavailable`); on-hand at the location must cover it (`insufficient_stock`, no negative consigned stock); cost = payout = the item's agreed amount; price default = item asking price, else the product default. The line stores `consignment_item_id` and `consignor_payout_snapshot`; the movement goes through `private.record_linked_movement` with the item (shop-owned parts write exactly Phase 4's values); then `refresh_consignment_item_status`. D24: 0 is a known price or cost. Phase 4's description:  22004 on null ids/quantity. Order: `private.lock_work_order` (P0002); `private.lock_stock(product)` and the unit FOR UPDATE (P0002); replay by line id before the open check (same job, inventory, product, unit, quantity → the line, its job_consumption movement and current on-hand, `replayed = true`; else `line_conflict`); `work_order_locked` (D15); `quantity_invalid` (1..999; unique: 1); P0002 / `product_archived` / `product_inactive`; `currency_mismatch`; `ownership_not_saleable` (product or unit not shop_owned, D27). Quantity: `unit_product_mismatch` if a unit is given; default location (lowest active sort_order, name) or `location_required`; `location_inactive`; on-hand may go negative (D23). Unique: `unit_required`, `unit_product_mismatch`, `unit_not_available`, `unit_location_mismatch`. `part_price_missing` / `part_cost_missing` (D24). Inserts the line (snapshots price, cost, rate; `cost_pending` false; description = name, or name · U-… · S/N …), the `job_consumption` movement (−quantity, cost snapshot), unit → held_for_customer and publication refresh, `stock_consumed`. Never returns a cost. |
| `void_line(line_id, reason)` inventory branch | S | Built (Phase 4, create or replace keeping Phase 3's signature, guard, reason rules, error order, effects, lock order and wrapper; `line_type_unsupported` is gone): already voided → id before the open check; `work_order_locked` (reopen first, D25); after `voided_*`: `lock_stock`, the unit's bike FOR UPDATE (if any), the unit FOR UPDATE, `bike_with_customer` when that bike has a customer (D29), one `reversal` of the line's job_consumption (`reversal_of_id`, same product, unit, location and cost snapshot; allowed at a location deactivated since), held unit → available, `refresh_unique_publication` (sold → public, no requirement check), `stock_reversed`. Concurrent voids serialise on the job; the unique `reversal_of_id` is the backstop. |
| `adjust_stock(request_id, product_id, location_id, quantity_delta integer, movement_type, reason, unit_cost money_amount = null)` → `table(movement_id bigint, on_hand integer)` | P(adjust_stock) | Built (Phase 4). `movement_type_not_manual` (only stock_adjustment ±, damaged −), `reason_required` / `reason_too_long`, `quantity_invalid`; a unit cost needs P(view_costs) (42501) and a positive delta (22023). `lock_stock`, then replay by request_id (same product, location, delta, type → that row; else `request_conflict`); P0002; `product_unit_tracked`; `product_archived`; `location_inactive`; `insufficient_stock` if a negative delta leaves the location below zero. Snapshot = unit_cost else the product default. Records actor and time (SPEC §23). |
| `transfer_stock(request_id, product_id, from_location_id, to_location_id, quantity integer, reason = null, inventory_unit_id = null)` → `table(movement_id bigint, location_id uuid, quantity_delta integer)` | P(manage_inventory) | Built (Phase 4; replaced with the same signature in Phase 6 for D54). `transfer_same_location`; `lock_stock` and the unit FOR UPDATE; replay by request_id (both rows; else `request_conflict`); `location_inactive`; `product_archived`. Quantity: `quantity_invalid`, `insufficient_stock`; a consigned product moves one item's stock, the oldest active item with the whole quantity at the source (`consignment_quantity_unavailable` otherwise), and both rows name it. Unique: `unit_required`, quantity 1, `unit_not_available` (available or reserved only), `unit_location_mismatch`; moves `location_id` (unit `moved` event; a consigned unit's rows take its item). Two `transfer` rows sharing request_id. |
| `create_unique_unit(unit_id, product_id, location_id, serial_number = null, condition = null, sale_price = null, direct_cost = null, bike_id = null, reason = null)` → `unique_unit_result (unit_id, short_id)` | P(manage_inventory); a cost needs P(view_costs) | Built (Phase 4). `lock_stock` before the replay (unit id exists with the same product → it; else `unit_conflict`); `product_not_unique`, `product_archived`, `product_inactive`, `location_inactive`; a bike is locked FOR UPDATE and must exist, not be archived (`bike_archived`), have no owner (`bike_has_owner`) and no unit (`bike_already_linked`). `private.register_unit` (shop_owned, D27), then a +1 `stock_adjustment` (reason default "Registered as a unique item", request_id = unit id), then `refresh_unique_publication` (a sold product with a new available unit is public again, D26). |
| `write_off_unit(request_id, unit_id, reason)` → `unit_status_result (unit_id, status)` | P(adjust_stock) | Built (Phase 4). `reason_required`; P0002; `lock_stock`, the unit FOR UPDATE; replay: a damaged movement with this request_id for this unit → current state, the key used for anything else → `request_conflict`; already written off → no-op; available or reserved → written_off plus a `damaged` −1; else `unit_not_available`. |
| `set_publication_status(product_id, status, reason = null)` → `publication_result (product_id, publication_status, public_slug)` | P(manage_inventory) | Built (Phase 4). 22004 on null ids; `reason_too_long` (> 500); `lock_stock(product)`, then the product FOR UPDATE (P0002). A target of `sold`, or leaving `sold` for anything but `archived` → `publication_sold_by_sale`. Same status → the row, no event. Otherwise the products trigger: `publication_transition_invalid`, `publication_requires_price` / `_photo` / `_available_unit`, slug at the first publish, `publication_changed {from, to}` with the reason. Phase 10 hooks the Shopify sync onto publication changes by trigger. |
| `split_unit_from_stock(new_product_id, unit_id, source_product_id, location_id, name, reason, serial_number = null, condition = null, sale_price = null)` → `split_unit_result (product_id, product_short_id, unit_id, unit_short_id)` | P(adjust_stock) and P(manage_inventory) | Built (Phase 4, D28). 22004 on null ids; `reason_required`, `reason_too_long` (> 480: the movements' reason is "Split to U-######: " + reason). `lock_stock(source)`, then replay (unit id on new_product_id → the same result; the unit id or new_product_id used otherwise → `unit_conflict`); P0002; `product_not_quantity`, `product_archived`, `ownership_not_saleable` (D27); P0002 / `location_inactive`; `insufficient_stock` (on-hand at the location < 1). Inserts a draft unique product (name; description, brand, category, currency from the source; price = sale_price else the source's; default cost = the source's), `private.register_unit` (shop_owned, cost = the source's default cost) and two `stock_adjustment` movements (−1 source, +1 unit) with the reason, cost snapshot and request_id = unit id. Writes the carried cost for a caller without P(view_costs) (definer path; the invoker cost-write guards still refuse that caller's direct writes); never returns a cost. 23514 checks re-raised without the row. |
| `daily_summary(from_day date = null, to_day date = null)` → table of the 27 `reporting.daily_summary` columns | S | Built (Phase 5). A null bound takes the other; both null = shop today; `report_range_invalid` when from > to or the range exceeds 366 days. One zero-filled row per day (`generate_series` left join the view), future and pre-history days as zero rows; placeholders passed through. D30: without view_financial_reports `currency`, `lines_recognised`, `gross_sales`, `consignment_sales`, `consignment_sales_total` and every cost column are NULL; with it but without view_costs `cogs`, `yield_total`, `cult_commons_share`, `bicii_yield_after_cc`, `loss_lines`, `loss_total`, `new_consignor_liability` are NULL. By day. |
| `today_dashboard(on_day date = null)` → `day, is_today, generated_at, can_see_financials, can_see_costs`, daily_summary columns 2–27, `received_now, waiting_now, ready_to_start_now, in_progress_now, awaiting_collection_now, open_jobs_now, overdue_now, low_stock_now, exceptions_now, cost_pending_lines` | S | Built (Phase 5). Null = today; a future day → `report_range_invalid`. Reads `public.daily_summary(d, d)` (gating in one place). The `*_now` snapshot (D31; BOARD_GROUPS: received+diagnosing, awaiting_customer+awaiting_parts+paused, ready_to_start, in_progress, completed+ready_for_collection, open, D20 overdue, `reporting.low_stock` rows, `operational_exceptions` rows) only when d is today, else NULL. `cost_pending_lines` = d's shop-currency entries with `cost_pending` (D14), NULL without view_financial_reports. |

| `operational_exceptions(max_rows integer = 50)` → `kind, severity, entity_type, entity_id, entity_label, subject_label, days, quantity, since` | S | Built (Phase 5, D34). Danger first, then oldest `since`; max_rows clamped to 1..200. Phase 9 drops and recreates it with appended columns. Since Phase 10 step 1 the view also carries `integration_failed` rows, for admins only (D86). |
| `financial_lines(from_day date, to_day date)` → the 32 `reporting.financial_lines` columns in order | P(view_financial_reports) (42501 otherwise) | Built (Phase 5). Null bounds as daily_summary; at most 31 days inclusive (`report_range_invalid`); PostgREST returns ≤ 1000 rows, so callers page with `.range()`. Without view_costs `unit_direct_cost`, `cult_commons_rate`, `cost_total`, `yield_total`, `cult_commons_share`, `bicii_yield_after_cc`, `is_loss` are NULL. By recognized_at, document_number, source_line_id. |

Deviates from the original row `record_retail_sale(lines[], customer_id, recognized_at, idempotency_key)`: the client's `sale_id` is the idempotency key. (1) Shape: null `sale_id` 22004; `lines` a JSON array of 1–50 (`sale_lines_required`, `sale_too_many_lines`); a unit twice `sale_duplicate_unit`; unknown customer P0002; `recognized_at` > now() + 5 min `sale_recognized_in_future` (past allowed, down to the stock's arrival: `private.sell_line`'s `sale_before_stock`, D55); a line with a `shopify_line_item_id` key `sale_line_invalid` (only Phase 10 writes one); the request fingerprint (`private.sale_request_fingerprint`: lines in order as {unit, product, location, quantity, price as money_amount text, item, shopify}, customer, recognized_at as given in UTC, trimmed notes; 22P02 / 23514 from its casts). (2) Header insert `on conflict (id) do nothing` (lock order 0; `recognized_at = coalesce(arg, now())`, shop currency): a replay with the same fingerprint returns the sale with `replayed` true (after the customer was archived or the unit sold by it, too), another payload `sale_conflict`. (3) `customer_archived`. (4) Locks: stock of every product (ascending), units, items. (5) `private.sell_line(sale, i, line, 'retail_sale')` per line in order. (6) `refresh_unique_publication` per unique product sold. Never returns a cost. |
| `private.sell_line(p_sale sales, p_line_number integer, p_line jsonb, p_movement_type movement_type)` → `sale_lines` | no grants | Built (Phase 6 step 2): THE single sale-line writer; Phase 10 calls it with `'online_sale'` and may replace it with the same signature to read more keys. The caller holds every lock. `p_line` is `{inventory_unit_id, unit_sale_price?, shopify_line_item_id?}` or `{product_id, location_id, quantity, consignment_item_id?, unit_sale_price?, shopify_line_item_id?}`; anything else `sale_line_invalid`.

D55: the sale's `recognized_at` before a consigned item's `received_at` or a unit's latest restock is `sale_before_stock`. NULL price `sale_price_required`, NULL cost `sale_cost_missing` (0 is valid, D24). Rate at `recognized_at`. Writes the line, one movement through `private.record_linked_movement` (−qty, the sale line, the item, cost snapshot), a unit → `sold` at `recognized_at` with `sold_sale_line_id`, and the item's status. Phase 10 step 1 replaced it (`…4000_shopify_order_processing`) with the same signature and body except: `shopify_line_part` joins both key allow-lists and is written to `sale_lines.shopify_line_part` (D80); no other change. |

Deviates from the original row `restock_unit(unit_id, location_id, reason)`: it names the sale line, which is also the replay key. Null ids 22004; `reason_required` / `reason_too_long`. Locks: a consigned unit's consignor FOR SHARE (0b), `lock_stock` (the unit's product, read unlocked), its bike, the unit, its item. Line P0002; another unit's line `restock_line_mismatch`; an already restocked line returns the unit's status with no write (even if it was sold again since); the consigned-unit permission (42501); an archived consignor `consignor_archived` (D47); status ≠ sold `unit_not_sold`; `sold_sale_line_id` ≠ the line `restock_line_mismatch` (a unit sold through a job is never restocked, D44); a customer-owned bike `bike_with_customer` (D29); location P0002 / `location_inactive`. With the reason: the line `restocked_at/by`; a `return` +1 movement linked to the line (and item), cost = the line's cost snapshot; the unit `available` at that location with `sold_sale_line_id` null; the item's status (sold → active, event with the reason); `refresh_unique_publication` (sold → public). The sale and refunds are untouched (D7). |
| `record_sale_refund(refund_id uuid, sale_id uuid, amount money_amount, reason text)` → `sale_refunds` | A or M (D94 amends D49: `private.can_record_refunds()`, a role check; 42501 otherwise, whatever permissions or exceptions the caller holds) | Built (Phase 6 step 2; guard replaced in `20261006000200_staff_role_permissions`, body unchanged). 22004 on nulls; replay by refund id (same sale, amount and trimmed reason → the row, else `sale_refund_conflict`); `reason_required` / `reason_too_long`; the sale FOR UPDATE (P0002); `sale_voided`; amount > sale total − earlier refunds `refund_exceeds_sale`; `restocked` false; status `refunded` when refunds reach the total, else `partially_refunded`.

(a) 22004 on null ids or agreed amount; `consignment_quantity_invalid`, `consignment_unique_quantity_one`, `consignment_received_in_future` (> 5 minutes ahead), `consignment_bike_requires_unique`. (b) The request's advisory lock, then replay by item id with a fingerprint of consignor, location, product, lower(trimmed name), tracking, quantity, agreed and asking (as text: "500" = "500.00") and bike: a match returns the item as it is now (even after the consignor was archived), else `consignment_item_conflict`. (c) The consignor FOR SHARE (P0002, `consignor_archived`); location P0002 / `location_inactive`; an existing product must be active, not archived, consignment-owned (`product_not_consignment`) and of that tracking (`consignment_tracking_mismatch`); none needs a name (`consignment_product_required`). (d) `lock_stock(product)`; a new draft consignment-owned product (price = asking, no default cost, shop currency); a bike FOR UPDATE with Phase 4's rules (D51); a unique item's unit through `private.register_unit` (consignment, sale price = asking, cost = agreed, the bike, the item); the item; one `consignment_received` movement (+quantity, cost snapshot = agreed, request_id = item id, the item); `refresh_unique_publication` for an existing unique product. |
| `update_consignment_terms(item_id, agreed_amount_owed = null, asking_price = null, reason = null)` → `consignment_item_result` | P(manage_consignments) | Built. `reason_too_long`; `private.lock_consignment_item` (stock, unit, item); null keeps a value, identical values are a no-op; `consignment_item_not_active`; a new agreed amount needs a reason (`reason_required`); a unique item's unit follows (cost = agreed, sale price = asking); lines already on a job keep their snapshots; one `terms_changed` event. |
| `add_consignment_charge(charge_id, item_id, description, amount, bearer charge_bearer, work_order_id = null)` → `consignment_item_charges` | P(manage_consignments) | Built (D4, D45). 22004 on nulls; `charge_bearer_required`; locks as above; replay by charge id (same item, trimmed description, amount, bearer, job → the row; else `consignment_charge_conflict`); unknown job P0002; `shop`: `consignment_item_not_active`, `shop_charge_unique_only`, `shop_charge_unit_not_available`; `consignor`: any status. 23514 by name (amount > 0, description ≤ 200). |

| `return_consignment_item(return_id, item_id, reason, quantity integer = null, location_id = null)` → `consignment_item_result` | P(manage_consignments) | Built (D50, D51); DATA-MODEL's original row was `return_consignment_item(item_id, reason)`: `return_id` is the client's per-call key, stored as the movement's `request_id` (movement ids are an identity column). 22004 on null ids; `reason_required` / `reason_too_long`; locks (stock, unit, item); replay: a movement with that request_id that is this item's `consignment_returned` (and matches quantity / location when given) → the item unchanged; any other → `consignment_return_conflict`; `consignment_item_not_active`. Unique: the unit must be available (`unit_not_available`; void it from its job first), `unit_location_mismatch`; −1 `consignment_returned`, unit → `returned_to_consignor` (the bike link stays, D51), then (lock order 7) a unique product with no unit left in stock and publication draft, internal_only or public → `archived`. Quantity: `location_id` required (22004); qty = given (1..remaining, `consignment_return_quantity_invalid`) or all of this item's stock there; the item's own stock there ≥ qty (D54; `insufficient_stock`, never another consignor's); −qty. Then the item status (returned when nothing is left or owed). |
| `record_settlement(settlement_id uuid, consignor_id uuid, amount money_amount, allocations jsonb, paid_at timestamptz = null, reference text = null, notes text = null)` → `settlement_result (settlement_id, consignor_id, amount, paid_at, replayed)` | P(manage_consignments) (D47) | Built (Phase 6 step 2). (1) 22004 on null ids or amount; unknown consignor P0002; `settlement_paid_in_future` (> 5 min ahead); allocations a non-empty array of `{consignment_item_id, amount > 0, override_reason?}` (`settlement_allocations_required`); `settlement_duplicate_item`; unknown item P0002; `settlement_item_wrong_consignor`; Σ ≠ amount `settlement_allocation_mismatch`; the fingerprint (amount and allocation amounts as money_amount text, allocations sorted by item, paid_at as given, trimmed reference, notes and override reasons). (2) Header insert `on conflict (id) do nothing` (`paid_at = coalesce(arg, now())`): a matching replay returns it with `replayed` true even after the outstanding changed, else `settlement_conflict`. (3) Consignor FOR SHARE (`consignor_archived`); items FOR UPDATE ascending. (4) Per allocation the item's outstanding from `reporting.consignor_item_ledger`: above `max(outstanding, 0)` without an override reason `settlement_exceeds_outstanding` (detail: short ID and outstanding). |
| `reverse_settlement(reversal_id uuid, settlement_id uuid, reason text)` → `consignment_settlement_reversals` | P(manage_consignments) (D47) | Built (Phase 6 step 2). 22004; `reason_required` / `reason_too_long`; replay by reversal id (same settlement → the row, else `settlement_reversal_conflict`); the settlement FOR UPDATE (P0002), then the consignor FOR SHARE; reversed under another id `settlement_already_reversed`; `consignor_archived`. The settlement and its lines stay; the ledger stops counting them. |
| `list_consignors(q = null, include_archived = false, max_rows = 50)` → `id, display_name, customer_id, customer_label, email, phone, archived_at, active_items, sold_items, awaiting_settlement_items, returned_items, owed, paid, outstanding, last_sale_at, last_settlement_at` | S | Built (Phase 6 step 2; `sold_items` and the gate on `awaiting_settlement_items` from the review). From `reporting.consignor_ledger`; `q`: every word of name or email, or phone digits with or without +65; `include_archived` true lists archived consignors only; by name then id; clamp 1..200. `awaiting_settlement_items` (items with outstanding > 0), owed, paid, outstanding NULL without consignment money access (D48); `sold_items` (status sold) for everyone. |
| `consignor_statement(target_consignor_id = null, target_item_id = null)` → `item_id, short_id, consignor_id, consignor_name, status, quantity, sold_qty, restocked_qty, job_held_qty, job_sold_qty, returned_qty, remaining_qty, received_at, sold_at, returned_at, return_reason, asking_price, last_sale_at, last_settlement_at, product_id, product_short_id, product_name, inventory_unit_id, unit_short_id, unit_status, bike_id, bike_short_id, agreed_amount_owed, liability, consignor_charges, shop_charges, owed, paid, outstanding` | S | Built (Phase 6 step 2). The arguments are `target_*` because PL/pgSQL refuses an argument named like a result column (the brief's `consignor_id` / `item_id`). Exactly one argument (22023); active first, then `last_sale_at` desc nulls last, then `received_at` desc. The last seven columns NULL without consignment money access (D48). |
| `consignor_payout_details(consignor_id)` → text | P(manage_consignments) | Built (Phase 6 step 2). P0002 for an unknown consignor. |
| `list_sales(from_at = null, to_at = null, q = null, max_rows = 50)` → `id, sale_number, source, status, recognized_at, customer_id, customer_label, line_count, first_description, has_consignment, restocked_lines, sale_total, refunded_total, cost_total, yield_total, cult_commons_share` | S | Built (Phase 6 step 2). `[from_at, to_at)`; `q`: sale number ignoring case and dash (exact or contained), customer name words, or line description words; voided excluded; newest first then id; clamp 1..200. The last three NULL without view_costs (D48). |
| `sale_lines_detail(sale_id)` → `id, line_number, description_snapshot, quantity, unit_sale_price_snapshot, sale_total, restocked_at, restocked_by_name, product_id, product_short_id, inventory_unit_id, unit_short_id, unit_status, unit_sold_sale_line_id, unit_ownership_type, bike_id, bike_short_id, consignment_item_id, consignment_short_id, consignor_id, consignor_name, unit_direct_cost_snapshot, cost_total, yield_total, cult_commons_rate_snapshot, cult_commons_share, consignor_payout_snapshot` | S | Built (Phase 6 step 2). Line order; an unknown sale returns no rows. Cost, yield, rate and Cult Commons NULL without view_costs; the payout NULL without consignment money access (D48). |
| `saleable_stock(q, max_results = 20)` → `kind, product_id, product_short_id, inventory_unit_id, unit_short_id, title, subtitle, location_id, location_name, on_hand, unit_price, ownership_type, consignment_item_id, consignment_short_id, consignor_name, rank` | S | Built (Phase 6 step 2). `unit`: available shop-owned and consigned units (item active), `unit_price = private.selling_price(product, unit)`; `product`: shop-owned active quantity products per location with on-hand > 0 (`selling_price(product)`), and consigned quantity products per active item with remaining > 0 and each location where that item has stock (D54), `on_hand = least(item on-hand there, location on-hand, remaining)`, `unit_price = coalesce(item asking, product default)`. Rank: exact U-/P-/C- ID, SKU or serial 1.0; ID containing the key (≥ 3) 0.6; every word in name/brand/consignor 0.45 + 0.4 × word similarity. Blank q nothing; clamp 1..50. No cost. |
| `label_preview(kind label_kind, entity_id uuid)` → `jsonb` | S | Built (Phase 8 step 1). Stable; `private.require_staff()`, then `private.label_content(kind, entity_id)` (§12): 22004 on nulls, P0002 unknown record, `label_entity_archived`, `label_unique_product_needs_unit`, `public_site_url_invalid`. Writes nothing. |
| `create_print_job(job_id uuid, kind label_kind, entity_id uuid, quantity integer, printer_profile_id uuid = null, label_template_id uuid = null, reprint_of_id uuid = null)` → `print_jobs` | S | Built (Phase 8 step 1, D56–D59). 22004 when job_id, kind, entity_id or quantity is null. Replay first: an existing `job_id` with the same kind, record and quantity, and the same printer / template / reprint for each one the caller passes non-null, returns the job; anything else `print_job_conflict`. Quantity 1..500 for a product, 1..10 for a unit or bike (`label_quantity_out_of_range`, D56). Content from `private.label_content` (its codes above). Printer: the one named, else the default, FOR SHARE (P0002; `printer_profile_inactive`); template: the one named, else the kind's default, FOR SHARE (`label_template_missing`, `label_template_inactive`, `label_template_kind_mismatch`); a default moved by a concurrent `set_default_*` is re-read in a new statement. `reprint_of_id` must exist (P0002) and be for the same kind and record (`print_job_reprint_mismatch`). Inserts status `queued` with the snapshots, `requested_by` = caller, `correlation_id` = `private.current_correlation_id()`, `on conflict (id) do nothing`; when a concurrent call with the same id committed first, re-reads the row in a new statement and applies the replay comparison (tested with forced overlap). |
| `set_print_job_status(job_id uuid, status print_status, error text = null)` → `print_jobs` | S | Built (Phase 8 step 1, D59). 22004; the job FOR UPDATE (P0002); the current status again → the row unchanged (a failed job keeps its first error); `queued` or a move the machine refuses → `print_job_transition_invalid`; `failed` needs a non-blank error (`print_job_error_required`; over 500 characters `reason_too_long`), other statuses ignore it. rendered: `rendered_at` = now; printed: `rendered_at` = coalesce(rendered_at, now), `completed_at` = now; failed: `completed_at` = now, `error` trimmed; `status_changed_by` = caller. Printed and failed at once: one wins, the other is refused (tested). |
| `set_default_label_template(template_id uuid)` → `label_templates` | A | Built (Phase 8 step 1). 22004; P0002; every template of the target's kind FOR UPDATE in id order, then the target re-read; `label_template_inactive`; already default → the row; else clears `is_default` on the others of that kind first, then sets it on the target (the partial unique index is not deferrable). Two admins at once: one default, the second call's target (tested). |
| `set_default_printer_profile(profile_id uuid)` → `printer_profiles` | A | Built (Phase 8 step 1). The same pattern over every profile (`printer_profile_inactive`). |
| `create_purchase_order(id, supplier_id, expected_at = null, supplier_reference = null, notes = null)` → `purchase_orders` | P(manage_purchasing) | Built (Phase 7). 22004 for null ids; replay by id first, FOR UPDATE (same supplier → the row unchanged, no event; another → `purchase_order_conflict`); P0002 / `supplier_archived`; insert in the shop currency (D62) catching a `purchase_orders_pkey` race. Never ON CONFLICT (the number trigger would burn a PO number per replay). |
| `update_purchase_order(purchase_order_id, supplier_id, expected_at, supplier_reference, notes)` → `purchase_orders` | P(manage_purchasing) | Sets all four exactly (null clears); locks the PO; `purchase_order_closed`; `purchase_order_supplier_locked` outside draft; identical → no update, no event. |
| `submit_purchase_order(purchase_order_id)` → `purchase_orders` | P(manage_purchasing) | Already submitted or further → unchanged; cancelled → `purchase_order_closed`; `purchase_order_needs_lines`; `supplier_archived`; else submitted_at/by. |
| `cancel_purchase_order(purchase_order_id, reason)` → `purchase_orders` | P(manage_purchasing) | D61. `reason_required` / `reason_too_long`; cancelled → unchanged; received → `purchase_order_closed`; receipts, movements and stock stay. |
| `set_purchase_order_line(id, purchase_order_id, product_id, quantity_ordered, unit_cost, expected_at = null, notes = null, reason = null)` → `purchase_order_lines` | P(manage_purchasing) | Upsert by id under the PO lock. Closed → `purchase_order_closed` (D65); existing: `purchase_line_conflict`, `purchase_line_below_received`, identical → unchanged; new: P0002, `purchase_line_unique_product`, `purchase_line_not_shop_owned`, `purchase_line_product_inactive`, `purchase_currency_mismatch`, `purchase_line_duplicate_product` (D62). 0 is a valid cost. Refreshes the status (a cut to the received total completes the PO). |
| `remove_purchase_order_line(line_id, reason = null)` → setof `purchase_order_lines` | P(manage_purchasing) | Unknown → no row. Locks the PO; `purchase_order_closed`; `purchase_line_has_receipts`; after submission `reason_required` and never the last line (`purchase_order_needs_lines`). Refreshes the status. |
| `receive_purchase(purchase_order_id, idempotency_key, lines jsonb, reference = null, received_at = null, notes = null)` → `purchase_receipts` | P(manage_purchasing) | Built (Phase 7); the 14 steps in §10 (replay, over-receipt, D64 dating, lock_stock, one movement per receipt line, D63 last cost, `received` event, status). |
| `purchase_receipt_by_key(idempotency_key)` → setof `purchase_receipts` | P(manage_purchasing) | Zero or one row, after a lost response. |
| `purchase_cost_defaults(supplier_id, product_ids uuid[])` → `table(product_id, unit_cost, source)` | P(manage_purchasing) | ≤ 200 ids (22023); only products a PO can hold (quantity-tracked, shop-owned, active, not archived; any other id is omitted like an unknown one, so it never reveals a unique or consigned product's cost, D60); per such product the supplier's last cost (`supplier_last`), else the product's (`product`, 0 included), else 0 (`none`). The PO line sheet's prefill (D60, D66). |
| `set_supplier_product(supplier_id, product_id, supplier_sku = null, lead_days = null, preferred = false)` → `supplier_products` | P(manage_purchasing) | Locks the product row, then upserts the link (never the last cost; a new link takes the product's currency); `preferred` clears the product's other preferred row. P0002 / `purchase_line_not_shop_owned` (a consigned or customer-owned product, D62) / `supplier_archived`. |
| `remove_supplier_product(supplier_id, product_id)` → setof `supplier_products` | P(manage_purchasing) | Deletes the link; no row on a replay. |
| `reorder_suggestions(supplier_id = null)` → `table(product_id, short_id, sku, name, on_hand, reorder_point, on_order, suggested_quantity, supplier_linked, preferred_supplier_id, supplier_sku, draft_po_numbers text[])` | S | Built (Phase 7, D66 D-REORDER; `20261005000500_purchasing_reorder.sql`). The shop-owned `reporting.low_stock` products (a consigned product below its reorder point is never listed, D62); `on_order` from `reporting.product_on_order` (submitted and partially received POs, never drafts); `suggested_quantity` = max(2 × reorder_point − on_hand − on_order, 0); `supplier_linked` / `supplier_sku` relative to the given supplier (false / null without one); `preferred_supplier_id` whatever was asked; `draft_po_numbers` the draft POs (any supplier) already holding the product, ascending, `{}` when none. Ordered by supplier_linked desc, suggested_quantity desc, name. No cost column (D60). |
| `create_purchase_order_from_low_stock(id, supplier_id, product_ids uuid[])` → `purchase_orders` | P(manage_purchasing) | Built (Phase 7, D66). 22004 for a null id/supplier or a null element; null or empty selection → `reorder_nothing_selected`; more than 100 ids → 22023. Replay by id with `create_purchase_order`'s mechanism (FOR UPDATE first, insert only when absent, `purchase_orders_pkey` unique_violation fallback, never ON CONFLICT): the same supplier returns the PO unchanged with no line added and the PO sequence untouched; another supplier → `purchase_order_conflict`. Else `supplier_archived` / P0002, a draft in `private.shop_currency()`, then one line per DISTINCT product in ascending id with `set_purchase_order_line`'s checks (P0002, `purchase_line_unique_product`, `purchase_line_not_shop_owned`, `purchase_line_product_inactive`, `purchase_currency_mismatch`, `purchase_line_duplicate_product`): quantity max(suggestion computed now, 1), capped at the line limit 100000; unit cost `private.default_purchase_unit_cost` (supplier last cost, else product cost incl. 0, else 0). `line_added` events come from the trigger, without a reason. Locks only the new PO row; products and stock are read unlocked. |
| `record_shopify_webhook(topic, webhook_id, shopify_event_id, shop_domain, api_version, triggered_at, headers jsonb, payload jsonb, body_sha256, body_bytes, hmac_valid, rejection_reason, correlation_id)` → `event_id, duplicate, event_status, job_id` | service role only | Built (Phase 10 step 1, D88, D89). 22004 / 22023 on shape; headers capped (16 lower-cased keys, ≤ 512 characters, `x-bicii-truncated`); rejected → one row per (reason, body sha) with no payload and no job; verified → dedupe on the webhook id (a repeat counts the delivery, no new job); a new event is skipped (`topic_not_handled`, `test_order`, `pos_order`) or gets a queued `shopify_event` job (`job_id`). |
| `claim_integration_jobs(max_jobs integer, only_job_id uuid = null)` → setof `integration_retry_queue` | service role only | Built (Phase 10 step 1, D87). Dismisses a running product sync stalled 10 minutes when its product has a queued one; claims up to clamp(max_jobs, 1, 50) jobs: queued and due (or the one named, even before it is due) or running and stalled 10 minutes, oldest due first, `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED`, one product sync per product and never beside a fresh running one; each → running, `locked_at` now, attempts + 1. |
| `process_shopify_order_paid(event_id)` / `process_shopify_refund(event_id)` / `process_shopify_event(event_id)` → `event_status, outcome, sale_id, error_code, error_message` | service role only | Built (Phase 10 step 1, D80–D82, D85, D87, D89): §13's algorithm; `process_shopify_event` dispatches by topic (others → skipped `topic_not_handled`). P0002 unknown event; 22023 wrong topic. Business failures never raise: they return `failed` with the code and the human message and leave the job `needs_attention` (or queued with backoff when transient). |
| `retry_integration_job(job_id)` → `integration_retry_queue` | A; P(manage_inventory) for product-sync jobs only (42501 otherwise) | Built (Phase 10 step 1, D86, D87). The job FOR UPDATE (P0002); done/dismissed → `integration_job_closed`; running → unchanged; else queued now with `max_attempts` ≥ attempts + 3, `last_retried_by/at`; audit `job_retried`. |
| `dismiss_integration_job(job_id, reason)` → `integration_retry_queue` | A | Built (Phase 10 step 1, D86, D87). `reason_required` / `reason_too_long` (`private.require_reason`); running → `integration_job_running`; done/dismissed → `integration_job_closed`; dismissed with the reason; a `shopify_event` job's event → skipped / `dismissed` (keeps its last error); an `orders/paid` event of an order with no sale is final for the order (D87): every `orders/paid` event of the order is locked in id order, its other open deliveries' queued or needs_attention jobs are dismissed ('Another delivery of this order was dismissed: ' ‖ reason; their events skipped / `dismissed`), and the order's waiting refund jobs close ('The order was dismissed: ' ‖ reason; their events skipped / `order_not_recorded`); a later delivery of the order is `earlier_delivery_skipped`. audit `job_dismissed` {closed_refund_job_ids, closed_order_job_ids}. |
| `link_shopify_variant(product_id, shopify_product_id, shopify_variant_id, reason)` → `shopify_product_sync` | A | Built (Phase 10 step 1, D84). Numeric ids or gids (`shopify_gid_invalid`); reason required; the product FOR UPDATE; another variant already on it, or a Shopify product BICII created for another product → `shopify_ids_conflict`; a variant on another product → 23505 `products_shopify_variant_id_key`; sets the two product columns with the reason (P4's history records `details_changed`); upserts the sync row as `external` (unless `bicii`), no handle, Publish online untouched; same ids → no-op; audit `variant_linked` {from, to}. |
| `link_shopify_customer(customer_id, shopify_customer_id, reason)` → `shopify_customer_link_result (customer_id, shopify_customer_id, earlier_online_sales)` | A | Built (Phase 10 step 1, D86). A composite result (a `returns table` would clash with the argument names). Reason required; the customer FOR UPDATE; a different id already linked → `shopify_customer_already_linked`; an id on another customer → 23505 `customers_shopify_customer_id_key`; never by email; recorded sales are never edited (`earlier_online_sales` counts the online sales of that Shopify customer still without a customer); same id → no-op; audit `customer_linked`. |
| `private.integration_exceptions()` → P5's nine exception columns | no API role | Built (Phase 10 step 1, D86): §14. |
| `private.purge_integration_events(older_than interval)` → `rejected_deleted, payloads_purged` | owner only, by hand (no API role, no cron) | Built (Phase 10 step 1, D88). 22023 under 30 days; deletes rejected rows last delivered before then; clears the payload of processed/skipped events processed before then (`payload_purged_at`), never failed, pending or open-job events. |
| `set_publish_online(product_id, publish)` → `shopify_publish_result (product_id, publish_online, sync_status, job_id)` | P(manage_inventory) | Built (Phase 10 step 2, D84, D86). A composite result (a `returns table` cannot reuse the argument name). Locks the product (P0002). Publishing: `shopify_product_archived`, `shopify_not_saleable` (customer-owned), `shopify_requires_public`, `shopify_price_missing` (`private.shopify_online_price` NULL; 0 is a price), in that order. Same value: the current state, `job_id` NULL, no job, no audit. Otherwise upserts the sync row and queues the product; `job_id` is the queued job this call created or reused (the app runs exactly that one); unpublishing a never-pushed product is `not_synced`, its queued job dismissed, `job_id` NULL. One `publish_online_changed {from, to}` audit row. |
| `request_product_sync(product_id)` → uuid | P(manage_inventory) | Built (Phase 10 step 2, D86). Sync now: `shopify_not_published` unless published or pushed before; clears `desired_hash` (a full push), returns the queued job (created or reused), due now. One `sync_requested` audit row per call. |
| `set_shopify_settings(online_location_id, storefront_url, accept_test_orders, reason)` → `shopify_settings` | A | Built (Phase 10 step 2, D83, D84, D89). 22004 without a location or `accept_test_orders`; the location must exist (P0002) and be active when it changes (`location_inactive`); storefront https or NULL (`shopify_settings_storefront_url_check`), trailing slashes trimmed; a reason is required when `accept_test_orders` changes (`reason_required`), optional otherwise; creates the row when absent; same values: unchanged, no audit. A new online location queues every published or pushed product. One `settings_changed {from, to}` audit row. |
| `product_sync_state(product_id)` → `shopify_product_sync_state` (§13's fields) | service role only | Built (Phase 10 step 2, D81, D83, D84). The sync worker's input (§13). P0002 unknown product; `shopify_settings_missing`. Never a cost. |
| `record_product_sync_result(product_id, job_id, outcome, shopify_product_id, shopify_variant_id, shopify_inventory_item_id, shopify_location_id, pushed_quantity, pushed_price, desired_hash, api_version, error_code, error_message, retriable)` → `shopify_product_sync` | service role only | Built (Phase 10 step 2, D83, D84, D87). Outcomes `pushed`, `unchanged`, `deferred`, `failed` (§13); 22023 for another; 22004 when a push lacks its ids or quantity or a failure its message; `shopify_ids_conflict`; lock order settings → product → sync row → job. |
| `private.shopify_online_price(product_id)` → money_amount; `private.enqueue_product_sync(product_id)` → uuid | no API role | Built (Phase 10 step 2): §13. |
| `grant_permission(target_staff_id, permission)` / `revoke_permission(…)` | A, or P(manage_staff) on a mechanic within the D11 ceiling (D93: a non-admin's target must be a mechanic, never themselves; never `manage_staff`; only permissions they hold) | Exception rows (`granted_by` = caller); replay-safe (no row change, no event). `grant_permission` refuses a permission the target's role implies (P0001 `permission_implied_by_role`, D92) before inserting; revoking a row that does not exist returns null. One `permission_granted` / `permission_revoked` event; the revoke event keeps the removed row's `granted_by`/`granted_at`. |
| `set_staff_active(target_staff_id, active, reason)` | A, or P(manage_staff) on a mechanic (D93) | Deactivating needs a reason (P0001 `reason_required`; `reason_too_long` over 500). Nobody deactivates themselves; only an admin changes an admin's or a manager's status (42501); the last active admin stays (55000). One `deactivated`/`reactivated` event with the reason; replaying the current state is a no-op. Deactivation also deletes the person's Supabase Auth sessions (trigger `staff_revoke_sessions`, D71). |
| `note_sign_in_attempt(buckets, window_seconds)` | service role only (the Admin's login actions) | Counts one sign-in attempt in each bucket for the current fixed window and returns the counts (PLAN D72, §1 "Sign-in attempt counters"); 22023 for malformed arguments. Not callable with the anon key or a user session. |
| `update_staff(target_staff_id, display_name, role, reason, expected_role)` | A or P(manage_staff); role changes A only (D93) | Null leaves a field as it is. `expected_role` (optional) is the role the caller's confirmation showed: checked against the row locked `for update`, a different current role raises P0001 `staff_role_changed` and nothing changes (the Admin always sends it, so a stale page cannot make a change its sheet did not describe). Nobody changes their own role; only an admin renames an admin or a manager (a non-admin renames mechanics only); the last active admin cannot be demoted (55000). `role_changed` (with the reason, ≤ 500 characters) / `details_changed` events; a role change also deletes the exceptions the new role implies, one `permission_revoked` event each with the same actor and reason (D92). Email is not editable (it must stay the login's email). |
| `staff_history(target_staff_id, max_rows)` | A or P(manage_staff) | `staff_events` for one person, newest first, with the actor's display name (≤ 500 rows, default 100). |
| `my_staff_profile()` | authenticated | Caller's staff row + effective permissions in enum order: what the role implies (`private.role_implies`: admin all, manager all but `manage_staff`, mechanic none) plus exceptions; inactive → none; zero rows for non-staff. |
| `create_staff(auth_user_id, display_name, email, role = 'mechanic')` | A or P(manage_staff); only A creates `admin` or `manager` (D93; 42501) | Links an existing Auth login (created server-side with the service-role admin API) to a new active staff row. Email must equal the login's email (`P0001 staff_email_mismatch`); duplicate email → 23505 `staff_email_key`. |
| `staff_roster()` | A or P(manage_staff) | Every staff row with its *granted* permissions (the exceptions on top of the role, D92), for Staff settings (a manage_staff holder could otherwise grant but not see permissions, §15). |
| `staff_directory()` | S | `id, display_name, role, active` of every staff member: how staff see colleagues' names (§15) without reading the `staff` table. |
| `transfer_bike_ownership(bike_id, to_customer_id, reason)` | S | `to_customer_id` null = the shop. Reason required (P0001 `reason_required`, `reason_too_long` over 500). Locks the bike; one `transferred` event with actor and reason (by trigger); replaying the current owner is a no-op. P0002 unknown bike/customer; `customer_archived`, `bike_archived`. Returns the bike. |
| `record_attachment(attachment_id, entity_type, entity_id, storage_bucket, storage_path, media_type, byte_size, width, height, caption, visibility)` | S | Entity must exist (P0002; `attachment_entity_unsupported` for a type without a table, none since Phase 6 added `consignment_item`); a `consignment_item` photo is internal only (`attachment_consignment_internal_only`, D52); bucket must match visibility (`attachment_bucket_mismatch`); path must be `{entity_type}/{entity_id}/{attachment_id}.{ext}` with ext matching the type (`attachment_path_mismatch`); photo types only (`attachment_media_type_unsupported`); the object must be in `storage.objects` (`attachment_object_missing`) with a matching mimetype (`attachment_media_type_mismatch`); Storage's size wins. Replay returns the same row; an id used for another file (`attachment_conflict`) or deleted (`attachment_deleted`) is refused; customer records are never public (`attachment_customer_never_public`), nor is a photo without width and height (an undecoded original, `attachment_original_never_public`). `created` event. |
| `set_attachment_visibility(attachment_id, visibility, new_bucket, new_path)` | S | internal ↔ customer stays in `media-internal`; to/from `public` the object must already be at the new location (copied by the server). Never public for a customer record or an undecoded original (`attachment_original_never_public`). Locks the row; `visibility_changed` event; replay is a no-op. |
| `delete_attachment(attachment_id, reason)` | S | Reason required. Deletes the row, `deleted` event with actor, reason and the row as payload. Returns a set: the deleted row (the server then removes the object), or no row on replay (PostgREST: `[]`). |
| `attachment_stray_objects(entity_type, entity_id)` | S | Objects under `{entity_type}/{entity_id}/` in either photo bucket that no attachment points at and that are safe to remove now (older than 10 minutes; in `media-internal`, with history or older than a day), at most 100. The server removes them when it shows the record. |
| `staff_search(q, kinds, max_results, archived)` | S | Typed hits `(kind, id, title, subtitle, short_id, rank)` across customers (name words in any order, email, phone digits with or without +65), bikes (short ID and serial ignoring case/spaces/dashes, brand/model/variant/colour plus owner name) and, from Phase 3, jobs (`work_order`: job number ignoring case/spaces/dashes, exact 1.0, contains ≥ 3 characters 0.6; title the bike, subtitle the customer · the first 80 characters of the requested work, short_id the job number; every status) and, from Phase 4, products (`product`: exact P- ID or SKU key, i.e. upper-cased without punctuation, 1.0; SKU key containing q's key, ≥ 3 characters, 0.7; every word of q in name/brand/SKU 0.45 + 0.4 × word similarity; title the name, subtitle `SKU · brand · N in stock` with N the ledger on-hand across locations, or `Unique item`, plus `Inactive` for an inactive product, which is still found) and units (`inventory_unit`: exact U- ID or serial key 1.0; serial key containing q's key, ≥ 3 characters, 0.7; every word of q in the product's name 0.45 + 0.4 × word similarity; title the product's name, subtitle `status · location · S/N serial` with status Available, Reserved, On a job, Sold, Written off or Returned to consignor). Exact short ID, serial, SKU or job number rank 1.0, exact email/phone 0.95, fuzzy below. Archived rows excluded, or (`archived` true) searched alone with the same matching, for the Archived lists (jobs are never archived, so none then; a unit by its own `archived_at`); `kinds` null = all, unknown kind 22023; `max_results` clamped to 1..100 (callers ask for one more than they show, to know the list is cut off). Phase 6 step 2 adds `consignor` (every word in name/email 0.5 + 0.4 × word similarity, phone digits contained 0.6, exact email or phone 0.95; title the name, subtitle email · phone; archived consignors only with `archived` true), `consignment_item` (exact C- ID 1.0, C- ID containing the key ≥ 3 0.6, every word in product name/brand and consignor name 0.45 + 0.4 × word similarity; title the product name, subtitle `consignor · status · U-…` or `Qty n`; never archived) and `sale` (exact S- number 1.0, number containing the key ≥ 3 0.6; title `S-… · $total`, subtitle the customer or `Walk-in` · the shop day; never archived; voided left out). From Phase 7 (`20261005000400_purchasing_search.sql`), suppliers (`supplier`: every word of q in name/contact/email/account reference 0.5 + 0.4 × word similarity, exact email or exact phone (with or without +65) 0.95, phone digits contained 0.6; title the name, subtitle `contact · phone · email`, no short_id; archived suppliers only with `archived`) and purchase orders (`purchase_order`: exact PO number key — `PO-000002`, `po 000002`, `PO000002` — 1.0, exact supplier reference key 0.95, PO number containing the key (≥ 3 characters) 0.6, every word of q in the supplier's search text 0.4 + 0.4 × word similarity; title the supplier's name, short_id the PO number, subtitle `status · expected 12 Oct 2026 · R of N received` (the date only when set, the count only when the PO has lines); POs are never archived, so none with `archived`; cancelled and received POs are found). **Merge hazard:** each phase's migration replaces the whole function, so the latest definition must contain every branch; the merged line's latest is `20261005000400_purchasing_search.sql`, which carries Phase 6's three kinds and Phase 7's two. `tests/db/staff-search.test.ts` checks that staff_search accepts every `SEARCH_KINDS` entry of `src/lib/search.ts`, which the app asks for by default. Later phases add a `private.search_<kind>` function and a branch. |
| `my_customer_profile()` | authenticated (C) | The caller's own `customer_profile` (id, names, email, phone, created_at); zero rows for non-customers. |
| `update_my_profile(first_name, last_name, display_name, phone)` | C | Own row only; null keeps a field, '' clears it; 42501 without a customers row. |
| `my_bikes()` | authenticated (C) | The caller's current, non-archived bikes without internal notes. |
| `my_bike_attachments(bike_id)` | authenticated (C) | `customer`/`public` attachments of one of the caller's own bikes; empty for anyone else's. |
| `my_work_orders()` | authenticated (C) | The caller's jobs (not cancelled), newest first: `id, job_number, bike_id, bike_short_id, bike_title, status customer_job_status, checked_in_at, completed_at, ready_for_collection_at, collected_at, currency, sale_total` (live lines). D17: by `work_orders.customer_id`, whatever the bike's owner or archived state now. |
| `my_work_order_lines(work_order_id)` | authenticated (C) | Live lines of one of the caller's non-cancelled jobs, in `created_at` order: `id, description, quantity, unit_sale_price, sale_total, currency`. Empty for anyone else's job. |
| `my_work_order_timeline(work_order_id)` | authenticated (C) | Oldest first `id, kind, status, attachment_id, created_at`: `checked_in` (status `received`); `status` for a status_changed/completed/ready_for_collection/collected/reopened event whose customer status differs from the previous entry's; `photo` for a `photo_added` whose attachment still exists and is customer-visible. No actors, notes, payloads, lines, assignments or costs. |
| `my_work_order_attachments(work_order_id)` | authenticated (C) | `customer`/`public` attachments of one of the caller's non-cancelled jobs (job photos are never public, D19), same columns as `my_bike_attachments`. |

## 17. Sequences and short IDs

`private.next_short_id(prefix text) returns text` reads a per-prefix sequence
(`private.seq_short_id_b`, `private.seq_short_id_j`, …, `maxvalue 999999 no
cycle`, so exhaustion raises rather than truncating) and zero-pads to six
digits. Unknown prefixes raise SQLSTATE 22023. Sequences
are never reset. The UUID is the primary key everywhere; short IDs are for
humans and QR codes.

## 18. Seed data (`supabase/seed.sql`)

Realistic and deterministic (fixed UUIDs so tests can reference them):
4 staff logins (D90–D94): Asha Admin (`admin@bicii.test`, admin), Kavya
Menon (`manager@bicii.test`, manager, no exceptions; auth
`a0000000-…-000000000004`, identity `a1000000-…-000000000004`, staff
`5a000000-…-000000000004`), Marcus Tan (`mechanic1@bicii.test`, mechanic,
`view_costs` as an exception granted by the admin) and Nur Aisyah
(`mechanic2@bicii.test`, mechanic, no exceptions), each an Auth login with
a random-secret bcrypt hash and no known password (`AUTH_USER`, `STAFF`,
`STAFF_EMAIL` in `tests/fixtures/ids.ts`), 6 customers with
10 bikes, shop hours Tue–Sun, 4 appointment types, 9 appointments, 1 customer login, 9 services, 2 locations,
12 quantity products with stock, 3 unique shop-owned bikes, 2 consigned bikes
(one sold, unsettled) and consigned kit, 4 in-store sales, 2 suppliers, 1 PO partially received, 9 work orders
spread across statuses and the last 9 days, settlements. (The Cult Commons
base rate is not seed data: the workshop catalog migration ships it, D21.)
The seed is applied to the local database and to a fresh preview
project; never to production.

Phase 1 part (done): customers `c1000000-…-00000000000N` (`CUSTOMER` in
`tests/fixtures/ids.ts`; only Chloe Lim has a login, added in the Phase 2
part) and bikes
`b1000000-…-0000000000NN` (`BIKE`, short IDs `B-000001`…`B-000010` in insert
order, `BIKE_SHORT_ID`; Phase 4 adds B-000011…B-000013 and Phase 5
B-000014…B-000017), one shop bike without an owner and one bike
transferred between customers (two ownership events). No attachments.

Phase 3 part (done): service categories `ca000000-…-00000000000N`
(`CATEGORY`: Servicing, Wheels & tyres, Brakes, Builds, Labour, sort 1–5),
services `5e000000-…-0000000000NN` (`SERVICE`; SGD price / default direct
cost): Basic Service 80/0, Full Service 200/0, Wheel True 35/0 (per wheel),
Tyre Installation 15/0 (per tyre), Brake Bleed 45/8 (per brake),
Drivetrain Service 90/5, Bike Build 250/0, Custom Labour 60/0 (per hour,
not public) and Suspension Fork Service 120/25 (inactive, archived 30 days
ago). Nine jobs `f1000000-…-00000000000N` (`WORK_ORDER`, job numbers
`J-000001`…`J-000009` in insert order, `JOB_NUMBER`), lines
`f2000000-…-0000000000NN` (`LINE`, all at rate 0.3000) and assignments
`f3000000-…-0000000000NN`. Times are relative to the shop day the seed
runs: `pg_temp.seed_at(N, '10:00')` plus the same minute/hour offsets (one
base local time per job, all between 08:00 and 18:00 Singapore time; see
"Phase 5 part"); d = shop days before the reset day, h = hours:

| Job | Customer, bike | Status | What it demonstrates |
|---|---|---|---|
| J-000001 | Tan, Tarmac | collected | The full walk: checked in −9d, in progress −8d, completed −7d, ready −7d+1h, collected −6d; lead Marcus; Full Service + Brake Bleed ×2: sale 290.00, cost 16.00, yield 274.00, Cult Commons 82.20; intake and completion notes. |
| J-000002 | Priya, Domane | ready_for_collection | Money the E2E tests assert: Basic Service, Tyre Installation ×2 and a manual "Continental GP5000 700×28c tyre" ×2 at 95.00 (cost 62.00): sale 300.00, cost 124.00, yield 176.00, CC 52.80, BICII after CC 123.20; approval flag with one `approval_flagged` event (Asha, −5d+1h); lead Nur. |
| J-000003 | Hafiz, Brompton | completed | Started −1d 10:00, completed −1d 16:00, not yet ready; lead Marcus with Nur as additional staff; Drivetrain Service. |
| J-000004 | Chloe, Giant | in_progress | Diagnosing −3d+1h then in progress −1d (a received → diagnosing step the customer never sees); Wheel True ×2. |
| J-000005 | Chloe, Surly | awaiting_parts | A note (Nur, −5d−1h) before waiting for the customer's part; Custom Labour ×1.5. |
| J-000006 | Daniel, Cannondale | awaiting_customer | Phase 3's one overdue job (D20: open, checked in −8d; Phase 5's H7 is the other); a diagnosis (Marcus, −8d+2h); no lines. |
| J-000007 | Nurul, Bianchi | received | Just checked in, unassigned, no lines: checked in at seed time, after the Bianchi's sale from Daniel. |
| J-000008 | Tan, Brompton | cancelled | Cancelled an hour after check-in with a reason (hidden from the customer, D17). |
| J-000009 | Priya, Tern | diagnosing | A voided line: Asha quoted a bottom bracket (45.00, cost 28.00), Nur voided it at −1d+3h; live total 80.00. |

So that every seeded timeline reads true (`workshop-seed.test.ts`):
(a) intake/completion notes and the approval flag are given in the
`work_orders` INSERT (the insert trigger writes only `checked_in`), and the
backdated `note_added`, `diagnosis_added` and `approval_flagged` events are
inserted by hand with their own time and actor; those columns are never
updated in the seed (that would stamp an event at seed time); (b) before
each block of writes `request.jwt.claims` names the staff member acting,
so every trigger-written actor equals the row's own `created_by` /
`assigned_by` / `voided_by` (Asha checks in and assigns; Marcus and Nur
walk their own jobs' statuses; lines with a cost are added by Asha or
Marcus, D14); (c) each job is inserted `received` with an explicit
`checked_in_at`, gets its assignments and lines while open, then walks its
statuses one UPDATE at a time with an explicit `status_changed_at`, times
strictly increasing and no line change after completion; (d) J-000007's
`checked_in_at` is `clock_timestamp()` at its insert, after the Bianchi's
`transferred` event. Still no attachments. (The seeded bikes themselves are
registered at seed time, after the backdated check-ins; only the jobs'
timelines are backdated.)

Phase 4 part (done, step 1): the 'Shop floor' location
(`1c000000-…-000000000001`, sort 10) comes from the inventory migration's
one-shop bootstrap; the seed re-inserts it with `on conflict do nothing` and
adds 'Workshop store' (`…0002`, workshop, sort 20) (`LOCATION`). Product
categories `ca000000-…-000000000006`…`…012` (kind product: Brakes, Tyres &
tubes, Drivetrain, Cables & hoses, Care, Cockpit, Bikes; `PRODUCT_CATEGORY`).
Products `9a000000-…-0000000000NN` (`PRODUCT`, `PRODUCT_SHORT_ID`) are
inserted directly as the owner with `request.jwt.claims` naming the admin
(so `created_by` and the history name an actor), in order, giving
`P-000001`…`P-000016`, dated −30d 07:00. The opening stock and the units
are dated −30d (from 08:00, a minute apart): owner statements writing
exactly the rows `adjust_stock` and `create_unique_unit` write (same request
ids, quantities, movement type, reason, cost snapshot, currency, actor), so
they never show as today's adjustments; history events written by triggers
(product and unit `created`, the bikes' stock link) keep seed time. The
inventory job goes through the real RPCs as the admin, at seed time (today),
every request id used once.

| Short ID | Product | Price / cost | Reorder | On hand after the seed |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| P-000001 | Road disc brake pads, resin (pair) | 28.00 / 13.50 | 10 | 34 Shop floor |
| P-000002 | Grand Prix 5000 700x25c tyre | 89.00 / 52.00 | 4 | 12 Shop floor |
| P-000003 | Road inner tube 700x23-28c Presta 60mm | 9.00 / 3.80 | 20 | 40 Shop floor + 20 Workshop store |
| P-000004 | Marathon Racer 16x1.35 tyre | 55.00 / 30.00 | 3 | 6 Shop floor (one consumed by J-000010, then reversed) |
| P-000005 | Inner tube 16in Schrader | 14.00 / 6.00 | 6 | 12 Shop floor (15 opening, one on J-000010, two sold on Phase 6's S-000002) |
| P-000006 | X11 11-speed chain | 45.00 / 24.00 | 5 | 26 Shop floor (8 opening + 18 received on Phase 7's PO-000002) |
| P-000007 | 105 CS-R7000 11-34 cassette (draft) | 109.00 / 68.00 | 2 | 7 Shop floor (3 opening + 4 received on Phase 7's PO-000001) |
| P-000008 | Pro brake cable kit | 35.00 / 16.00 | 4 | 2 Shop floor (low) |
| P-000009 | SM-BH90 hydraulic hose 1000mm | 28.00 / 12.00 | 5 | 1 Shop floor (low) |
| P-000010 | Dry chain lube 120ml | 16.00 / 7.00 | 6 | 18 Shop floor (28 after Phase 7's PO-000002) |
| P-000011 | DSP 3.2mm bar tape | 49.00 / 26.00 | 4 | 7 Shop floor |
| P-000012 | Tubeless sealant 237ml | 32.00 / 17.00 | 3 | 1 Shop floor + 1 Workshop store (low) |
| P-000013 | Colnago C64 Disc 52s (pre-owned), unique | 6800.00 / 4200.00 | — | unit U-000001 (bike B-000011) |
| P-000014 | Brompton C Line Explore (ex-demo), unique | 1950.00 / 1400.00 | — | unit U-000002 (bike B-000012) |
| P-000015 | Surly Bridge Club 27.5 M (new old stock), unique | 1650.00 / 1100.00 | — | unit U-000003 (bike B-000013) |
| P-000016 | X10 10-speed chain (discontinued), archived | 35.00 / 18.00 | — | none |

All are internal_only except P-000007 (draft); none is public and there are
no attachments. Opening stock is written as `adjust_stock` would, with request ids
`9c000000-…-0000000000NN` per product at its first location and
`9c000000-…-0000000001NN` for the Workshop store rows of P-000003 and
P-000012 ("Opening stock count"). Three shop bikes without an owner,
`b1000000-…-000000000011`…`…013` (`BIKE.shopColnago`, `shopBrompton`,
`shopSurly`; B-000011…B-000013), are in stock as units
`9b000000-…-00000000000N` (`UNIT`, U-000001…U-000003, written as
`create_unique_unit` would: shop-owned at the Shop floor, bike linked, a +1
'Registered as a unique item' movement at the unit's direct cost).
`reporting.low_stock` lists exactly P-000009, P-000008 and P-000012.

The inventory job `9e000000-…-000000000001` (`INVENTORY_JOB`, J-000010) is
Hafiz's Brompton (D18; his only other job, J-000003, is completed), lead
Asha, left `received`: line `9d000000-…-000000000001` is one Inner tube 16in
Schrader from the Shop floor (live), and line `…0002`, one Marathon Racer
tyre, was voided ("Customer brought their own tyre"), so the ledger shows a
`job_consumption` and its linked `reversal` (`SEED_LINE`). It is kept out of
`WORK_ORDER` / `JOB_NUMBER`, which list Phase 3's nine jobs.

Phase 5 part (done): **history relative to the reset day.** Every Phase 3,
4 and 5 timestamp is written through the session-temporary
`pg_temp.seed_at(days_ago integer, local_time time) returns timestamptz`,
defined before the first Phase 3 statement: for `days_ago > 0` it is
`((private.shop_today() - days_ago) + local_time) at time zone
'Asia/Singapore'`; for day 0 it maps `local_time` proportionally into the
part of today that has already passed (`shop_day_start(today) + (now() −
shop_day_start(today)) × local_time / 24 h`), so today's rows keep their
order and are never in the future at any time of day. The seed runs in one
session and one transaction (`now()` is the same everywhere); Singapore has
no DST, so `seed_at(n, t) − seed_at(m, t)` is exactly (m − n) × 24 h. Phase
3 keeps its day offsets (not moved to days 7–13, which would make every
open Phase 3 job overdue); J-000007 and J-000010 stay at seed time; Phase
4's opening stock and units are at day 30; trigger-written history events
keep their own (seed) time where the seed does not write them by hand.
No migration was needed: no Phase 3/4 trigger overwrites an owner's
timestamps.

Eleven jobs `d5000000-…-0000000000NN` (`REPORT_JOB`, J-000011…J-000021 in
insert order, `REPORT_JOB_NUMBER`), lines `d5100000-…` (`REPORT_LINE`, all at
rate 0.3000), assignments `d5200000-…`, written as Phase 3's are (owner
inserts, explicit times, claims naming whoever acts; a part from stock is
the line, one `job_consumption` movement at the line's time with −quantity
and cost snapshot = the line's unit cost, and a hand-written
`stock_consumed` event one second later). d = shop days before the reset
day; times are Singapore time. Four more customers' bikes
`b1000000-…-000000000014`…`17` (B-000014…B-000017: Chloe's Specialized
Diverge, Daniel's Canyon Endurace, Priya's Cervelo R5, Hafiz's Dahon Mu;
`BIKE.chloeDiverge`, `danielEndurace`, `priyaCervelo`, `hafizDahon`) are
inserted before H1 so that, as seed realism (the schema allows it), no
bike has two jobs open at once and none is collected while another job on
it is open (`reporting-seed.test.ts`). A bike awaiting collection may take
a newer job (J-000003 then J-000010; H6 then J-000009):

Six quantity products `d5300000-…-00000000000N` (`REPORT_PRODUCT`,
`REPORT_PRODUCT_SHORT_ID`, P-000017…P-000022) in a new product category
'Wheels' (`ca000000-…-000000000013`, sort 8) and the existing ones, with
opening stock at the Shop floor at d30 08:30 (request ids
`d5400000-…-00000000000N`), so Phase 4's figures are untouched: Carbon disc
wheelset 700c, 45mm (Hunt, 849.00 / 400.00, reorder 1, 4 → 2 after H2, H3),
Corsa Pro 700x28c tyre (Vittoria, 95.00 / 35.00, reorder 2, 6 → 5), SLA-110
11-speed chain (YBN, 45.00 / 22.00, reorder 3, 10 → 9), Disc 34 RS brake
pads (SwissStop, 32.00 / 15.00, reorder 5, 20 → 19), Butyl inner
700x25-32c, Presta 48mm (Panaracer, 12.00 / 5.00, reorder 10, 30 → 24) and
CO2 cartridge 25g, threaded (Genuine Innovations, 6.00 / 3.00, no reorder
point, 10 → 12). None is low: `reporting.low_stock` still lists exactly
P-000008, P-000009 and P-000012. Stock adjustments by Asha (request ids
`d5400000-…-00000000001N`): A1 d2 11:00, brake pads −1 `stock_adjustment`
"Damaged packaging, written off" (not significant); A2 d1 16:30, inner −6
`damaged` "Water damage in storage" (significant, D33: ≥ 5 units; 30.00 at
cost); A3 d0 (08:30 scaled), CO2 +2 `stock_adjustment` "Recount found two in
the workshop drawer" (not significant). No open job is checked in on d7, so
which jobs are overdue never depends on the time of day the reset ran.

At the anchor the snapshot is received 4 (J-000007, J-000009, J-000010,
T3), waiting 3 (J-000005, J-000006, H7), ready to start 0, in progress 2
(J-000004, T1), awaiting collection 4 (J-000002, J-000003, H5, H6), open 9,
overdue 2 (J-000006, H7), low stock 3 and exceptions 3 (overdue J-000006 and
H7, uncollected H6). The per-day figures for d0…d6 (Phase 3/4 rows
included) are `SEED_DAYS` in `tests/fixtures/reporting.ts`, written by hand
together with `SPEC_EXAMPLE_JOBS`, `SEED_SNAPSHOT`, `SEED_EXCEPTIONS` and
`SEED_ADJUSTMENTS`; `tests/db/reporting-seed.test.ts` proves the views
reproduce them exactly.

**The anchor rule.** The seed is anchored to the shop day `db:reset` ran,
which need not be today (the DB test template is built once per run, an
existing database keeps its seed, a run can cross Singapore midnight).
Tests read the anchor from T3's check-in without the functions under test
(`seedToday()` in `tests/db/reporting-fixtures.ts`; `E2E_SEED_ANCHOR`, set
by `tests/e2e/global-setup.mts`, with `seedAnchor()` / `anchorDay(n)` in
`tests/e2e/helpers.ts`), count days back from it, and skip with a message
the assertions that need the anchor to be today. Reset (`npm run
db:reset`) to move the demo's "today".

Phase 2 part (done): **the schedule and appointments**, written as the
owner after every job exists (the owner bypasses the booking rules; the
triggers still enforce the status machine, stamps, bike ownership,
history and the work-order link), acting as Asha Admin (Marcus for
J-000014's completion, Chloe for her own bookings). IDs in
`tests/fixtures/ids.ts` (`SHOP_HOURS`, `APPOINTMENT_TYPE`, `CLOSURE`,
`APPOINTMENT`, `CUSTOMER_LOGIN`).

- Settings: slot 30, capacity 2, notice 120, horizon 60, limit 3, cancel
  cutoff 120 (D37's defaults), `public_site_url` `http://localhost:4000`
  (the local public site; D9 note).
- Weekly hours `e3000000-…-00000000000N`: Tue–Fri 10:00–19:00; Sat
  09:00–12:30 and 13:30–18:00; Sun 09:00–13:00; Monday one INACTIVE
  10:00–19:00 row (closed, hours remembered).
- Types `e1000000-…-00000000000N`: Service drop-off (30 min, 1 unit,
  public), Repair assessment (30, 1, public), Custom build consultation
  (60, 2, public), Warranty inspection (30, 1, staff-only).
- Closures `e4000000-…-00000000000N`: closed all day on the first
  Wednesday ≥ 7 days ahead ("Team at the Taipei Cycle show"); custom hours
  12:00–16:00 on the first Thursday ≥ 8 days ahead ("Short day for
  stocktake"); both within 14 days, whole shop-local days as
  `save_closure_override` stores them.
- Chloe Lim's customer login: Auth user
  `a0000000-…-000000000101` (chloe.lim@example.com, no usable password: the bcrypt hash of a random
  secret, as for the seeded staff; D10, R-035),
  identity `a1000000-…-000000000101`, linked to `CUSTOMER.chloe`.
- Appointments `e2000000-…-00000000000N`, each inserted `booked` a day or
  more before its start and walked one update at a time with explicit
  stamps: (1) d3 10:00 Repair assessment, Tan's Tarmac, checked in at
  J-000014's check-in, linked to J-000014 (both link events dated then, so
  its timeline reads checked_in, appointment_linked, …) and completed at
  J-000014's completed_at (D36, D40); (2) d1 11:00 Daniel's Cannondale,
  no-show (11:20); (3) today 10:00 Priya's Domane, arrived; (4) today 10:30
  Hafiz's Brompton, confirmed (J-000010 is open on it); (5) today 15:00
  Chloe's Giant, booked online with a note; (6) today 16:00 Nurul's
  Bianchi, booked; (7) first Tue–Fri ≥ tomorrow 11:00 Tan's Brompton,
  confirmed; (8) first Tue–Fri ≥ 3 days ahead 10:00 Priya's Tern,
  cancelled by staff ("Customer travelling"); (9) first Tue–Fri ≥ 5 days
  ahead 14:00 Chloe's Surly, Custom build consultation booked online.
  Today's and yesterday's rows ignore the weekly hours on a Monday or
  Sunday; future rows avoid Mondays and the closures; nothing is more than
  14 days ahead (tests book on clear days ≥ 21 days ahead). Daniel has no
  upcoming booked/confirmed appointment; Chloe at most two upcoming online
  bookings; today at most three expected arrivals.
- D41 counts per seeded day (`SEED_DAYS`): d3 scheduled 1, arrived 1; d1
  scheduled 1, no-show 1; d0 scheduled 4, arrived 1; other days 0.
  `tests/db/appointment-seed.test.ts` proves the rest.

Phase 6 part (done, step 2): **consignment and sales**, at the end of the
seed. The three consignors are inserted directly as the owner (like
customers); everything else goes through the RPCs as the admin
(`request.jwt.claims` set, then reset to `''`), so every rule and trigger
runs. Intake dates, sale `recognized_at` and settlement `paid_at` use
`pg_temp.seed_at(days_ago, local_time)` so the history lands on the Phase 5
fixture days; movements, charges, item events and the refund carry seed
time. Fixed-UUID prefixes: `6a` consignors, `6b` items, `6c` intake
products, `6d` intake units, `6e` charges, `6f` sales, `7a` refunds, `7b`
settlements, `7c` reversals, `7e` returns (`CONSIGNOR`, `CONSIGNMENT_ITEM`,
`CONSIGNMENT_PRODUCT`, `CONSIGNMENT_UNIT`, `CONSIGNMENT_CHARGE`, `SALE`,
`SALE_REFUND`, `SETTLEMENT`, `SETTLEMENT_REVERSAL`, `CONSIGNMENT_RETURN` in
`tests/fixtures/ids.ts`).

- Consignors: Kelvin Yeo (no customer record, PayNow), Daniel Ong
  (`CUSTOMER.daniel`), Chloe Lim (`CUSTOMER.chloe`, bank transfer,
  internal notes).
- Items (on a fresh build C-000001…C-000004, products P-000023…P-000026,
  units U-000004…U-000006): C-000001 Kelvin's Colnago C64 Disc, unique,
  agreed 2400.00, asking 4200.00, d20, a 120.00 shop-borne charge, unsold;
  C-000002 Daniel's Cervélo R3, unique, 500.00 / 1000.00, d18, a 45.00
  consignor-borne charge; C-000003 Chloe's six Rapha jerseys, quantity,
  35.00 / 70.00, d15; C-000004 Kelvin's Dura-Ace crankset, unique, 300.00 /
  520.00, d12, returned to him at seed time.
- Sales (`record_retail_sale`): S-000001 d5 11:20 Priya, 2 jerseys naming
  C-000003 (140.00 / cost 70.00 / yield 70.00 / Cult Commons 21.00);
  S-000002 d4 15:05 walk-in, 2 × P-000005 Inner tube 16in Schrader
  (shop-owned, 14.00 / 6.00: 28.00 / 12.00 / 16.00 / 4.80), with a 14.00
  refund (one tube); S-000003 d3 16:40 Hafiz, the Cervélo at its selling
  price (SPEC §10's consignment example: 1000.00 / 500.00 / 500.00 /
  150.00); S-000004 today 10:30 walk-in, 1 jersey by FIFO from C-000003
  (70.00 / 35.00 / 35.00 / 10.50).
- Settlements: Chloe 30.00 paid d3 18:00 (PayNow 2991), reversed ("Wrong
  amount; the transfer was $40."); Chloe 40.00 paid d2 12:00 (PayNow 3002).
- Ledgers (`EXPECTED_CONSIGNOR_LEDGER`): Kelvin owed 0.00, outstanding
  0.00, 1 active, 1 returned; Daniel liability 500.00, consignor charges
  45.00, owed 455.00, paid 0.00, outstanding 455.00; Chloe liability
  105.00 (3 sold, 3 left), paid 40.00 (the reversed 30.00 excluded),
  outstanding 65.00. Lines: `EXPECTED_SALE`. Daily consignment columns
  (`SEED_DAYS`): d5 1 / 140.00 / 70.00, d3 1 / 1000.00 / 500.00, d0 1 /
  70.00 / 35.00, other days 0. `tests/db/consignment-reporting.test.ts`
  proves them.

Phase 7 part (done): **purchasing, built through the RPCs.** A section
after the Phase 6 part of `supabase/seed.sql` (before Phase 8's print jobs
and Phase 10's Shopify part), run with `request.jwt.claims` naming Asha
Admin (reset to '' afterwards), so PO history, the `purchase_received`
movements and the supplier last costs are what the app writes. It runs after
the Phase 6 part and creates no products, units, bikes or customers, so
Phase 6's short IDs (P-000023 .. P-000026, U-000004 .. U-000006) are
unchanged: it uses Phase 4's products (`PRODUCT`) and the Shop floor
(`LOCATION.shopFloor`). Ids use the `d7` prefix
(`tests/fixtures/ids.ts`):

- Suppliers `d7000000-…-00000000000N` (`SUPPLIER`), inserted directly
  (suppliers have no create RPC; the app inserts them under RLS), dated
  −20d: `veloParts` Velo Parts Asia Pte Ltd (Kenneth Lim,
  sales@veloparts.test, +65 6123 4501, https://veloparts.test, account
  BICII-0042, "Order by Thursday noon for Monday delivery."), `tropicTyre`
  Tropic Tyre & Tube Co (Siti Rahman, orders@tropictyre.test, +65 6234
  5502, account TT-1187) and `oldSpoke` Old Spoke Trading (archived −15d;
  no links, no POs).
- Links (`set_supplier_product`, SKU, lead days, preferred): Velo Parts
  supplies the cassette, chainX11, chainLube, cableKit, hydraulicHose
  (preferred) and the GP5000 tyre (not preferred); Tropic Tyre the GP5000
  tyre and roadTube (preferred). The low-stock sealant has no supplier.
- POs `d7100000-…-00000000000N` (`PURCHASE_ORDER`, `PO_NUMBER`
  PO-000001…PO-000005 in creation order), lines
  `d7200000-…-0000000000NN` (`PURCHASE_ORDER_LINE`), receipt idempotency
  keys `d7300000-…-00000000000N` (`RECEIPT_KEY`). Every line's unit cost is
  the product's current cost:

| PO | Supplier | Lines (qty × cost) | Dates (d = shop days before the reset day, Singapore time) | State |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| PO-000001 | Velo Parts, ref SO-7702 | cassette 4 × 68.00 | expected d9; created d12 10:00, submitted d11 09:30, received d9 14:00 at the Shop floor (DN-5402) | received; cassette 3 → 7 |
| PO-000002 | Velo Parts, ref SO-7781 | chainX11 20 × 24.00, chainLube 10 × 7.00 | expected d1; created d6 10:00, submitted d5 09:30; one receipt d3 11:30, DN-5531: 18 chains + 10 lubes | partially received (SPEC §14: 20 ordered, 18 received, 2 outstanding), overdue; chainX11 8 → 26, chainLube 18 → 28 |
| PO-000003 | Tropic Tyre | gp5000Tyre 6 × 52.00 | expected in 3 days; created d2 10:00, submitted d2 10:20 | submitted, nothing received; 6 on order |
| PO-000004 | Velo Parts | cableKit 6 × 16.00, hydraulicHose 9 × 12.00 (their D66 suggestions) | created d1 09:00 | draft ("In draft PO-000004" on the reorder screen) |
| PO-000005 | Tropic Tyre | roadTube 20 × 3.80 | created d1 15:00, submitted d1 15:10, cancelled at seed time | cancelled, "Supplier out of stock until next quarter"; 20 cancelled |

On order after the seed (`reporting.product_on_order`): GP5000 tyre 6,
chainX11 2. Supplier last costs: Velo Parts cassette 68.00, chainX11
24.00, chainLube 7.00 (the receipts upsert the links).

Chronology (D64 D-RECEIPT-TIME): each PO is created and submitted through
the RPCs, then, BEFORE it is received, its `created_at` and `submitted_at`
are back-dated with a plain UPDATE as the owner (those columns write no PO
event; `pg_temp.seed_at`), and `receive_purchase` records the receipt with
its past `received_at`. The `purchase_received` movements keep seed time
(Phase 4's ledger is append-only with no effective date; their reason
carries the delivery date, e.g. "PO-000002 received 2 Oct 2026 11:30").
PO events are moved to the moment each stands for, so an order's History
agrees with its Details and Receipts: created at `created_at`, lines a
minute apart after it, submitted at `submitted_at`, received at the
receipt's `received_at` (its status change a second later); PO-000005's
cancellation stays at seed time. The append-only trigger is disabled for
that one seed-only UPDATE and re-enabled straight after
(`purchasing-seed.test.ts` checks the chronology).

Fences on the earlier phases: (1) every receipt cost equals the product's
current `default_direct_cost`, so D63 changes no cost and writes no
`cost_changed` event; (2) receipts touch only the cassette, chainX11 and
chainLube, none of them low stock or with an on-hand figure a test pins
(the brief's suggested brake pads for PO-000001 were swapped for the
cassette because `staff-search.test.ts` pins "34 in stock"), and each stays
above its reorder point, so `reporting.low_stock` still lists exactly
P-000008, P-000009 and P-000012 and Today and `tests/fixtures/reporting.ts`
are unchanged; (3) the draft's products are low-stock products no receipt
touches; (4) Phase 5's daily summary and Today count only
`job_consumption`, `reversal`, `stock_adjustment` and `damaged` movements,
never `purchase_received`. `tests/db/purchasing-seed.test.ts` checks the
state.

Phase 8 part (done, step 1): **print jobs**, after the Phase 7 part. The
built-in templates (`1ab00000-…`, `LABEL_TEMPLATE`) and printer profiles
(`a8000000-…`, `PRINTER_PROFILE`) come from the labels migration, not the
seed. Five jobs (`a9000000-…`, `PRINT_JOB` in `tests/fixtures/ids.ts`) are
inserted as the owner by `pg_temp.seed_print_job`, which builds the
content with `private.label_content` and the snapshots from the built-in
rows exactly as `create_print_job` does, so their QR payloads use the
seeded `public_site_url` `http://localhost:4000` (`SHOP.publicSiteUrl`, the
database QR base; E2E's `E2E_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` in
`tests/fixtures/public-site.ts` is the environment's scan-only base).
Times use `pg_temp.seed_at`. No product is published by the Phase 8 part
(publishing needs a public photo); tests build published fixtures in their
own transactions. Since Phase 10 the seed publishes exactly one product
(below), listed in `SEEDED_PUBLIC_PRODUCT_SHORT_IDS`.

- `productPrinted`: P-000011 bar tape × 10, browser, printed; requested
  and confirmed by Marcus (mechanic1); created d2 11:00, rendered 11:01,
  completed 11:02.
- `unitFailed`: U-000001 (the Colnago, bike B-000011) × 1, PDF, failed
  "Label roll ran out halfway through"; Asha (admin); d1 15:00.
- `unitReprint`: the same unit × 1, PDF, `reprint_of_id` = unitFailed,
  printed; Asha; d1 15:10.
- `bikeUnconfirmed`: B-000001 (Tan's Tarmac) tag × 1, browser, rendered and
  not confirmed; Nur (mechanic2); today 09:30.
- `productQueued`: P-000011 × 10, PDF, queued; Marcus; today 10:00 (E2E
  renders and downloads it read-only; nothing changes its status).

Phase 10 part (step 1): **Shopify**, at the very end of the seed (fixed
ids `d1000000-…`, exported from `tests/fixtures/ids.ts` as
`SHOPIFY_PRODUCT`, `SHOPIFY_PRODUCT_SHORT_ID`, `SHOPIFY_GID`,
`SHOPIFY_SETTINGS`, `SHOPIFY_WEBHOOK_ID`, `SHOPIFY_ORDER`). The seed runs
without a signed-in staff member, so it writes the settings, products,
stock, photo, Shopify ids and sync row directly as the owner (the products
as Phase 4's, with the admin in `request.jwt.claims`) and sends the
webhooks through the real service-role RPCs (`record_shopify_webhook`, then
`process_shopify_event`), as the webhook route will.

- `shopify_settings`: online location Shop floor, Shopify location
  `gid://shopify/Location/9300000001`, storefront
  `https://shop.bicii.example`, `accept_test_orders` true (dev/E2E only;
  production never runs the seed).
- Products P-000027 … P-000033, shop-owned, quantity-tracked, opening stock
  at the Shop floor 30 days back: `syncedTyre` (Pirelli P Zero Race,
  95.00 / 55.00, 12; the only PUBLIC seeded product, with one public product
  photo row that has no Storage object; linked to
  `gid://shopify/Product/9000000027` / `ProductVariant/9100000027`),
  `e2ePhone` / `e2eTablet` (20 each, journey 5), `e2eLinkPhone` /
  `e2eLinkTablet` (20 each, no ids; the unmapped-variant journey), `stack`
  and `stackExternal` (50 each; step 3's live-stack test).
- Webhooks: `seed-webhook-0001` orders/paid #1001, 1 × syncedTyre at 95.00,
  processed 8 shop days back at 14:20 (outside `SEED_DAYS` 0–6, so the
  daily fixtures are unchanged) → S-000005 (online, customer null, Shopify
  customer `7200000001`), one `online_sale` −1; `seed-webhook-0002`
  refunds/create 5.00 on #1001 → one `sale_refunds` row, S-000005
  `partially_refunded`, no movement; `seed-webhook-0003` orders/paid #1002
  for the unmapped variant `9199999999` "BICII cotton cap" → failed, its job
  `needs_attention` (one admin-only `integration_failed` exception, so an
  admin's `exceptions_now` is 4: `SEED_SNAPSHOT`); `seed-webhook-0004` a
  rejected delivery (`hmac_invalid`, no payload).
- Last, syncedTyre's sync row: published, `synced`, origin `bicii`, handle
  `bicii-p-000027`, inventory item `9200000027`, pushed a day ago at its
  on-hand (11) and selling price (95.00), `desired_hash` NULL so the first
  real sync pushes it once. The seed is one transaction and step 2's
  enqueue triggers are deferred to commit, so the seed fires them
  (`set constraints all immediate`) before inserting the row, while no
  product has one; they queue nothing, and any product-sync job is closed.
  syncedTyre's `public_items.buy_online_url` is
  `https://shop.bicii.example/products/bicii-p-000027`.
- `tests/db/shopify-webhooks.test.ts` "Seeded integration data is
  consistent" and `tests/db/shopify-sync.test.ts` "Seeded sync data is
  consistent" prove them.
