# User guide

Audience: BICII staff and mechanics using the Admin on a phone in the
workshop or an iPad at the counter. Admins: shop settings, staff and
permissions are in [OPERATIONS.md](OPERATIONS.md#product-administration).

Applies to: `feat/staff-roles` (2026-10-06): `feat/auth-email-otp` after
its integration with the main line and purchasing, plus the three staff
roles admin, manager and mechanic (not deployed; on a developer machine at
http://localhost:3000). Staff sign in with an emailed code.

Last walkthrough: not walked through by a person. These flows are exercised
by the E2E specs `tests/e2e/auth.spec.ts`, `workshop.spec.ts`,
`workshop-board.spec.ts`, `inventory.spec.ts`, `inventory-publish.spec.ts`,
`scan.spec.ts`, `appointments.spec.ts`, `appointment-settings.spec.ts`,
`today.spec.ts`, `customers-bikes.spec.ts`, `staff.spec.ts`, `roles.spec.ts`,
`consignment.spec.ts`, `consignment-journey.spec.ts`, `sales.spec.ts` and
`purchasing.spec.ts`, on an iPhone 13 and an iPad viewport: 138 passed
locally at the Phase 7 integration on 2026-10-05, and the latest green CI
run on GitHub is [PR #7 e2e](https://github.com/abhishekcheriangeorge-ops/bicii-book/actions/runs/37276834195/job/111655595521).
Where a step below is not covered by a spec, it says so.

## Your first useful result

1. Open the Admin (on a developer machine: http://localhost:3000). You see
   **Staff sign in**.
2. Enter your **Email** and press **Email me a code**. The screen says
   **Check your email**.
3. Open the email "Your BICII sign-in code" and type the 6-digit **Code**,
   then press **Sign in**. The code works once, for 10 minutes; only the
   newest code works. No password is needed, and there is none. On a
   developer machine only, the seeded logins work and their codes are read
   from the devstack's mail catcher
   ([ENGINEERING.md](ENGINEERING.md#clean-checkout-to-running-application));
   a real shop has its own logins, created by an admin's invite.
4. **Today** opens with a greeting and today's date. On a phone the tabs at
   the bottom are Today, Jobs, Scan, Inventory and More (Customers, Bikes,
   Appointments, Settings and the rest); on an iPad every section is in the
   rail on the left.

If it fails:

- No email: check the address and your spam folder, wait a minute, then
  press **Send a new code** (it unlocks 60 seconds after the last one) or
  **Use a different email**. The screen says "Check your email" for every
  address, also one without a login, so a typo shows no error.
- "That code is wrong or has expired. Check your latest email or send a new
  code." (an older code stops working when a new one is sent).
- "This email doesn't have access to BICII Admin. Ask an admin to invite or
  reactivate you." (the code was right, but you are not active staff).
- "Too many attempts. Wait a minute and try again."
- "Sign-in is unavailable right now. Try again in a minute." (the service
  is down; tell whoever runs the system).

A link you opened before signing in takes you back there afterwards.

Your own details, your role (Admin, Manager or Mechanic), what it lets you
do and **Sign out** are under Settings → Your profile: the card **Your role
and access** lists every permission you have, marks any given to you on top
of your role as **Extra access**, and lists **Record refunds** for admins and
managers.

## Routine tasks

### Check a bike in as a new job

- Before you start: the customer's name (or find them by name, phone,
  email, B- number or serial).
- Steps:
  1. **Jobs** → **New job**. The intake has five steps and a review.
  2. Customer: search, or **New customer** (First name, Last name) →
     **Create customer**.
  3. Bike: choose one of theirs, or **Add bike** (Brand, Model) → **Add
     bike**. **Next**.
  4. Work: **Requested work** (required) and **Condition on arrival**.
     **Next**.
  5. People: pick the **Lead mechanic** and any **Additional staff**.
     **Next**.
  6. Services: tap the services to include. **Next**, check the review,
     then **Create job**.
  7. The job opens on **Intake photos**: **Choose photos**, then **Done**.
- Success looks like: the job page with its J- number, the photos, the
  people and the totals; its timeline starts "Checked in as J-…".
- If it fails: an interrupted intake offers "Continue the intake you
  started at …" (**Continue** or **Discard**). "Say what the customer
  wants done." means Requested work is empty. "That bike belongs to someone
  else. Transfer it to this customer first." "That customer is archived.
  Unarchive them before checking in a bike."

### Move a job through its statuses

- Before you start: open the job (Jobs, search, or scan its label).
- Steps: use the large buttons for the usual next step: **Start work**,
  **Diagnose**, **Waiting on parts**, **Pause**, **Resume**, **Complete**,
  **Ready for collection**, then **Collected…** and **Mark collected**
  (Collected is final, so it asks again). Any other allowed move is under
  **Change status**, with an optional **Note**.
  - Reopen a completed job (or one ready for collection): **Change
    status** → **Reopen job…**, answer "Why are you reopening this job?",
    then **Reopen job**. A unique item sold on the job goes back on hold
    for it. (Reopen is not covered by an E2E spec.)
  - Cancel an open job: **Change status** → **Cancel job…**, answer "Why
    is this job being cancelled?", then **Cancel job**.
- Success looks like: a toast "J-…: <new status>" and the status in the
  timeline. A completed job says "Completed jobs are locked. Reopen to
  change lines."
- If it fails: "A job can't move to that status from where it is now."
  "Give a reason for this change." "Void the job's lines before cancelling
  it. Voiding a part returns it to stock." A collected or cancelled job
  cannot change: "This job is collected or cancelled and can no longer
  change."

### Add services, parts and other lines to a job

- Before you start: the job is open (not completed).
- Steps:
  - **Add service**: pick the service, adjust **Unit price** or
    **Quantity** if needed, press **Add service**.
  - **Add part**: search by name, SKU, P- or U- number. Each choice shows
    what is in stock where ("40 at Shop floor · 60 total"). Choose
    **Quantity** and where to **Take from**; **Price each** is optional
    (empty charges the selling price). Press **Add part**.
  - **Add manual line**: **Description**, **Quantity**, **Unit price** and,
    with cost access, **Unit cost** ("Enter 0 when there is no direct cost.
    Left empty, the line is marked cost pending.").
  - To remove a line: **Void…** on its row, give the reason, **Void line**.
    Nothing is deleted; **Show voided** lists them. Voiding a part returns
    it to stock.
- Success looks like: a toast such as "Added 1 × <part>. 39 left at Shop
  floor." (a unique item: "It is on hold for this job."), and the totals
  update.
- If it fails:
  - Taking more than a location holds is allowed but warned: "Only 2 at
    Shop floor. Adding 3 takes the count below zero; ask whoever does stock
    counts to recount." (D23).
  - "This part has no sale price. Enter a price or ask someone to set one."
  - "This part has no cost yet, so its yield cannot be worked out. Ask
    someone with cost access to set it." (staff with cost access see "This
    part has no cost yet, so it can't be added. Set its cost on the product
    first.") A price or cost of 0 is a real value; only a missing one is
    refused.
  - A line marked **Cost pending** counts its cost as 0: "Provisional: 1
    line has no cost entered, so cost, yield and Cult Commons count it at 0.
    Void it and add it again with its cost." The figures stay overstated
    until then ([RISKS R-005](RISKS.md#r-005--cost-pending-lines-overstate-yield-and-cult-commons)).
  - "No part in stock matches. Archived, inactive and customer-owned items
    are not offered." Consigned items are offered, marked "Consigned ·
    <consignor>" (see [Use a consigned item on a job](#use-a-consigned-item-on-a-job)).
  - "This job is completed or closed. Reopen it to change its lines."

### Receive a consigned item

- Before you start: you need **Manage consignments**. Have the agreed
  amount owed to the consignor and the asking price ready.
- Steps:
  - **Consignment** → **Receive item** (or **Receive item** on a
    consignor's page, which fixes the consignor).
  - **Consignor**: search by name, phone or email. Someone new: type the
    name and choose **New consignor "…"**; fill in phone or email and,
    optionally, link their **Customer record** (it fills in the name,
    phone and email). They are created with the item.
  - **One item (bike, frame, wheelset)** or **Several identical**. A bike
    may link a **Shop bike record**; only bikes with no owner that are not
    in stock are offered. If the bike is registered to the consignor,
    first open the bike and **Transfer** it to the shop with a reason such
    as "Consigned by Daniel Ong" (D51).
  - **Name**, **Brand**, **Description**, **Category**; for one item the
    **Serial number** and **Condition** (public once published); for
    several, the **Quantity**; **Kept at**.
  - **Amount owed to the consignor when it sells** (per item; 0 is
    allowed) and the **Asking price** (the public, label and sale price).
    With View costs you see "If it sells at the asking price: yield … ·
    Cult Commons … · BICII keeps …".
  - **Received** (today unless you change it), **Agreement notes**,
    **Internal notes**. Press **Receive item**.
- Success looks like: "C-000123 received" and the item's page, where you
  add **Listing photos** (on the product; public once published) and
  **Agreement photos** (the signed agreement; always internal: "Agreement
  photos show the consignor's terms, so they stay internal.").
- If it fails: "That consignor is archived. Unarchive them first."; "The
  intake date can't be in the future."; "That bike belongs to a customer
  …" (transfer it to the shop first). Change terms later with **Edit
  terms** (a new amount owed needs a reason). Add work on the item with
  **Add charge**: choose **Consignor pays** (deducted from what we owe
  them) or **Shop pays** (added to the cost of the sale, so it lowers
  yield; one item only, before it is on a job or sold). There is no
  default (D4); void a charge with **Void…** and a reason.

### Use a consigned item on a job

- Before you start: the job is open; the consigned item is for sale.
- Steps: **Add part** on the job, search the item's name or U-/P-/C-
  number. Consigned choices show "Consigned · <consignor>" (several
  identical also show the C- number of the consignment they come from:
  the oldest one with stock left; at the location you take it from, the
  part comes from the oldest consignment that has that many there). The
  price is the asking price;
  **Price each** may change it. Press **Add part**.
- Success looks like: "Added … It is on hold for this job." The line shows
  "Consigned · <consignor>", linked to the item. When the job is
  **Completed** the item reads "Sold, awaiting payment" and the consignor
  is owed the agreed amount (D44).
- If it fails: consigned stock never goes below zero: "Only 2 of this
  consigned item at Shop floor. Consigned stock can't go below zero.", and
  "No single consignor has that many of this item at that location. Use
  fewer, or one consignor's stock at a time." To take it back, reopen the job and void
  the line; reopening alone removes what is owed until the job is
  completed again.

### Record a payment to a consignor

- Before you start: you need **Manage consignments**.
- Steps: open the consignor (Consignment → Consignors) → **Record
  payment**. Enter **Amount paid**, **Paid on** (today by default) and the
  **Reference**. Each item with something owed has a row, oldest sale
  first: type an amount per item, or press **Auto-fill**. **Add another
  item** pays an item that is not owed yet. Press **Record payment of
  $x**.
- Success looks like: "Payment of $200.00 recorded for <name>"; **Balance**
  shows Owed, Paid and Outstanding, and the payment appears under
  **Payments** with its allocations. "Settled" means everything owed has
  been paid; "Nothing owed yet" means nothing has sold.
- If it fails: the button stays disabled while the rows show "Unallocated
  $x" or "Over by $x", and while a row pays more than that item is owed
  without an answer to "Why pay more than is owed?". A wrong payment is
  corrected with **Reverse…** and a reason (the whole payment; it stays in
  the list, struck through). A negative balance reads "Overpaid $x
  (consignor owes the shop)": it clears with a later sale, by voiding a
  consignor-paid charge or by reversing a payment, never automatically
  (D46).

### Return an item to its consignor

- Before you start: you need **Manage consignments**; the item is for sale.
- Steps: open the item → **Return to consignor…** → answer "Why is it going
  back?"; for several identical, choose where from (only places holding
  this consignor's stock) and **How many** (all of their stock there by
  default). Press **Return to consignor** (or **Return N to consignor**).
  Another consignor's stock of the same item is never handed over (D54).
- Success looks like: the stock leaves the shop; a single item reads
  **Returned**; a quantity reads "2 of 3 left"; the history shows "1
  returned to consignor" with the reason. Nothing is owed for returned
  stock.
- If it fails: "Return at least one, and no more than the shop still has."
  "There isn't that much stock at that location." means this consignor
  has less there: choose the other location. An item on an open job must come off the job first. A returned bike
  keeps its link to its bike record; transfer the bike back to the
  consignor's customer record on the bike page ([R-020](RISKS.md#r-020--a-bike-record-consigned-once-cannot-be-consigned-again)).

### Record an in-store sale

- Before you start: anyone signed in can sell (D48). The item is in stock
  (a unique item is Available; it is not on a job).
- Steps: **More → Sales → New sale**, or **Sell** on a consignment item, a
  unit or a counted product (it starts with that item). Search the name,
  SKU or U-/P-/C- number under **Add item** and choose a result (each
  shows where it is, how many and the price; consigned ones show
  "Consigned · <consignor>"). The **Price** is the selling price; change
  it if you agreed another. For several, set **Quantity** (up to what is
  there). **Add item** adds more. Choose the **Customer** if they are on
  file (empty is a walk-in). **Sold earlier?** lets you enter when it was
  sold (not in the future, and not before the item came into the shop:
  a consigned item's intake, or the restock of a returned unit; D55).
  Press **Record sale · $x**.
- Success looks like: "S-000123 recorded" and the sale's page: the items,
  the total and who recorded it; the stock is lower, a unique item reads
  Sold ("Sold on S-…" on its page) and a consigned item is owed to its
  consignor. With View costs the sheet previews cost, yield and Cult
  Commons, and the sale page shows them.
- If it fails: "Below the asking price" and "Below cost: this sale loses
  money" are warnings, not blocks (D53). "That item has already been
  sold." outlines the line that went meanwhile: remove it and record the
  rest. "There isn't that much stock at that location." means the count
  changed: lower the quantity. "This item has no selling price. Enter
  one." needs a price. A date in the future is marked on **Sold at**;
  "A sale can't be dated before the item came into the shop." needs a
  later date. "No single consignor has that many of this item at that
  location." means the consigned stock there belongs to several
  consignors: sell fewer, or pick each consignor's line. A sold bike is not
  transferred to the buyer: use **Transfer** on the bike page (D51).

### Refund a sale

- Before you start: an admin or a manager records a refund (D94, amending
  D49). A mechanic does not see **Record refund**, whatever extra access
  they have.
- Steps: open the sale (Sales, or search its S- number) → **Record
  refund**. The **Amount** starts at what is left to refund; change it for
  a partial refund. Press **Record refund of $x…**, answer "Why is it
  being refunded?" and press **Refund $x**.
- Success looks like: "Refund of $x recorded"; the sale reads Partly
  refunded or Refunded and lists the refund with its reason. Nothing goes
  back into stock: if the item came back, restock it (below) (D7).
- If it fails: "That's more than is left to refund on this sale." The
  financial reports still count the sale in full: the period reports
  (Phase 9, screens to come) show refunds as "refunds recorded" beside
  gross sales on the day the refund is recorded, never taken off (D102, a
  build default; [R-021](RISKS.md#r-021--reports-overstate-net-sales-after-a-refund-or-restock)).

### Restock an item that came back

- Before you start: you need **Adjust stock**; for a consigned item also
  **Manage consignments** (D46). Only a single item (U- number) sold on a
  sale is restocked; an item sold through a job goes back by reopening the
  job and voiding the line.
- Steps: open the sale (or the unit's page, "Sold on S-…") → **Restock…**
  on the item → choose where it goes back if asked (default: where it was
  sold) → answer why → **Restock**.
- Success looks like: "U-000123 is back in stock"; the line reads
  Restocked and the unit Available again. A consigned item goes back on
  sale for its consignor and is no longer owed to them; money already paid
  for it stays paid (the balance may read Overpaid).
- If it fails: a unit whose bike now belongs to a customer cannot go back
  into stock (D29); a consigned item whose consignor is archived cannot
  either: "That consignor is archived. Unarchive them first." (the same
  applies to reopening a job that used it, D47); a restock never refunds
  money: record a refund too if the customer was paid back.

### Adjust stock or move it between locations

- Before you start: Adjust stock needs the Adjust stock permission;
  Transfer needs Manage inventory. Open the product (Inventory, search, or
  scan).
- Steps (adjust): **Stock** → **Adjust stock**. Choose the **Location**,
  **Add or remove**, the **Quantity**, the **Type** (Adjustment, or
  Damaged for stock removed) and a **Reason** (or a quick reason such as
  "Opening stock count" or "Stock count correction"). Check "After saving"
  ("Shop floor: 0 → 10") and press **Save adjustment**.
- Steps (transfer): **Stock** → **Transfer**. Choose **From**, **To** and
  **Quantity**, optionally a **Reason**, then **Move stock**.
- Success looks like: "Stock saved. Shop floor: 10", or "Moved 2 to
  <location>"; the movement appears under Recent movements and **All
  movements**, with the reason. (Transfer is not covered by an E2E spec.)
- Consigned stock moves one consignor's stock at a time: the oldest
  consignment with that many at **From** (D54). "No single consignor has
  that many of this item at that location." means move fewer, in two
  transfers.
- If it fails: a manual count can never go below zero: "<location> has 3. A
  count can't go below zero by hand; check the number." (Save stays
  disabled). "Give a reason for this stock change." "Choose two different
  locations." "That location is inactive. Choose another or reactivate it."

### Order from a supplier

- Before you start: you need **Manage purchasing**. Only counted,
  shop-owned, active products can be ordered (D62): unique items are
  registered one by one in Stock, and consigned stock comes in through
  **Receive item** in Consignment, never on an order.
- Steps:
  - **Purchasing** → **Suppliers** → **New supplier** for someone new:
    **Name**, **Contact name**, **Phone**, **Email**, **Website**,
    **Account reference** (BICII's account number with them), then
    **Create supplier**.
  - On the supplier's page, **New order** (the supplier is fixed), or
    **Purchasing** → **New order** and pick the supplier. Optionally a
    **Supplier reference** and an expected date; **Create order** opens
    the draft.
  - **Add line**: search the product (each option shows on hand and on
    order), then **Quantity** and **Unit cost**, prefilled from the
    supplier's last cost or the product's cost when there is one;
    **Add line**. Change a line with its **Change line** button.
  - **Submit order** when it is sent to the supplier.
- Success looks like: the order's `PO-` number and the status Submitted;
  the product page's **Suppliers & orders** card shows "On order".
- If it fails: "Only shop-owned products can be ordered from a supplier."
  (a consigned or customer-owned product); "That product is already on
  this order. Change its line instead."; "An order needs at least one
  line." To stop an order, **Cancel order…** with a reason (D61): what was
  already received stays in stock.

### Receive a delivery

- Before you start: you need **Manage purchasing**; the order is submitted
  (a draft says "Submit the order before receiving").
- Steps:
  - Open the order (scan or type its `PO-` number) → **Receive**.
  - For each line, **Receive now** (it starts at what is still to come)
    and the **Actual unit cost** from the supplier's note ("Differs" shows
    when it is not the ordered cost; 0 is allowed for free goods);
    **Receive into** a location (each line can go somewhere else).
  - **Delivery note reference**, **Received** (now unless the note is older;
    at most 30 days back, D64) and **Notes**.
  - Press **Receive N items** once.
- Success looks like: "Received 18 items. 2 still to come.", the order
  Partially received with "18 of 20 received · 2 to come", or Received when
  everything has come. The stock goes up once, and the product's cost and
  the supplier's last cost become the actual cost (D5, D63).
- If it fails: more than is to come is refused; raise the line's ordered
  quantity on the order first (D65). If the connection drops, the screen
  checks whether the delivery was recorded and either shows it or offers
  **Retry**, which never receives twice. A delivery note already recorded
  on this order asks you to tick **This is a different delivery**. A wrong
  count after receiving is corrected with **Adjust stock** and a reason;
  a fully received order is closed, so extra units go on a new order.

### Reorder low stock

- Before you start: you need **Manage purchasing**.
- Steps: **Purchasing** → **Reorder** (also from the Inventory low-stock
  filter and Today's low-stock tile). Choose the **Supplier**; products
  linked to it start ticked, each with on hand, on order and a suggested
  quantity (twice the reorder point less what is on hand and on order,
  D66). Press **Create draft order (N products)**.
- Success looks like: a draft order with those lines at the supplier's
  last cost; check quantities and costs, then **Submit order**.
- Only shop-owned products are listed. A consigned product below its
  reorder point still counts on Today and the Inventory low-stock filter,
  but it is never reordered here: more of it comes from its consignor
  through intake. If only consigned products are low, the list says
  "Nothing is below its reorder point."

### Publish a product

- Before you start: Manage inventory. Publishing needs **A name**, **A sale
  price**, **A public photo** and, for a unique item, **An available
  unit**.
- Steps: on the product, **Publication** → **Make internal** (a new
  product starts as Draft). Add a photo with **Choose photos**, open it and
  choose **Public** in the viewer ("Photo is now public"). Then
  **Publish**. **What the public sees** previews the public listing and the
  QR label URL is shown.
- Success looks like: toast "Published" and "Public" in the header.
  **Unpublish** makes it internal again ("Listing is internal only").
- If it fails: Publish stays disabled and the card says what is missing,
  e.g. "Still needed: A public photo." The database refuses with "Add a
  public photo before publishing.", "Set a selling price before
  publishing." or "There is no available unit to publish."

### Scan a label or type a code

- Before you start: the camera works only over HTTPS or on `localhost`.
- Steps: **Scan**. Allow camera access and hold the label inside the
  square, or type the code into **Or type the code on the label** (any
  case) and press **Open**.
- Success looks like: the bike, job, product or unit opens.
- If it fails: "Enter a code like P-000123" (not a code). "No record with
  P-999999" with **Scan again**. A QR code from elsewhere shows "Not a BICII
  label" and is never opened; scanning continues. "The camera only works
  over a secure connection. Open the app over HTTPS (or on localhost)."
  (type the code instead; [RUNBOOK](RUNBOOK.md#the-camera-scanner-on-phones-and-ipads)).
  "Camera access is blocked. On iPhone: Settings → Safari → Camera → Allow,
  then reload this page." Labels cannot be printed yet (Phase 8).

### Book and run an appointment

- Before you start: the shop's hours, capacity and appointment types are set
  by an admin.
- Steps (book): **Appointments** → **Book appointment** (phone: **Book**),
  or a customer's page → Appointments → **Book appointment**. Choose the
  **Customer**, the **Type**, a **Date** (or **Or pick a date**), a free
  **Time**, optionally the **Bike** and an **Internal note**, then
  **Book**.
- Steps (on the day): open the appointment from Appointments or Today.
  - **Arrived** when they arrive ("Marked as arrived"); **Confirm** marks
    a booking confirmed.
  - **Check in**: choose the bike, check **Requested work** (the customer's
    note is filled in), pick the **Lead mechanic**, and under **New or
    existing job** choose **New job** or the bike's open job; press **Check
    in and open job** (or **Check in and link J-…**).
  - **No-show…** → "Mark as a no-show? If they turn up later today, you can
    still reinstate them as arrived." → **Mark no-show**. **Reinstate as
    arrived** undoes it if they turn up.
  - **Cancel appointment…** → "Why is the appointment cancelled?" →
    **Cancel appointment**. The customer is not told automatically.
- Success looks like: "Checked in. J-… opened." and the job linked both
  ways; "Appointment cancelled"; the appointment's History records each
  step and who did it.
- If it fails: "That time has just filled up. Pick another time." (the
  times reload; the rest of the form is kept). "The shop is closed then."
  "Mark a no-show only after the appointment has started." There is no
  reschedule: cancel and book again, and phone the customer
  ([R-017](RISKS.md#r-017--appointments-mvp-has-no-reschedule-and-no-customer-messages)).

### Read Today

- Steps: **Today**. Right now (Received, Waiting, Ready to start, In
  progress, Awaiting collection, Overdue), the day's flow (Checked in,
  Started, Completed, Ready for collection, Collected, Cancelled),
  Appointments (arrivals, still expected, arrived), Stock (parts used, low
  stock, significant adjustments), Needs attention, Activity and the Last 7
  days. Use the day navigator for an earlier day and **Back to today**.
- Money (Gross sales) appears only with View financial reports; Direct
  costs (COGS), Yield, Cult Commons and BICII after Cult Commons also need
  View costs.
- Success looks like: tiles that link to the jobs behind them.
- Money counts jobs completed and in-store sales recorded on the day.
  **Consignment sales** (sales and completed jobs with a consigned item)
  opens that day's sales (the jobs are under Jobs completed);
  **New consignor liability** (also View costs) opens Consignment.
- If it fails: a "Provisional: …" note means cost-pending lines are counted
  at 0. Refunds and restocks are not taken off (D102: the period reports
  show refunds beside gross instead).
- Needs attention lists what you may see (D108): every staff member sees
  overdue and uncollected jobs, stock below zero, stale holds, lines in
  another currency (job lines and, since Phase 9, sale lines) and units
  whose status disagrees with the stock ledger; consignor money unpaid more
  than 30 days after the sale (D107) only with Manage consignments or View
  costs (admins and managers by role); failed integrations only admins.
  Each row opens its record (a job, product, item, consignment item or
  sale). **See all** beside the count, or the "Showing the 20 most urgent
  of …" line, opens the full list on Reports → Exceptions.

### Read reports

- Steps: **Reports** (More on a phone, the rail on an iPad). Choose
  **Day**, **Week** (Monday to Sunday) or **Month**, step with the arrows
  (or `[` and `]` on a keyboard), tap the dates to pick another day, or
  **Custom** for any range up to two years. **Today** comes back to now.
- Choose the **Date basis** (View financial reports): **Sale date** is the
  financial figure (jobs on the day they were completed, sales on the day
  they were paid); **Check-in**, **Completed** and **Collected** count
  jobs only, on that day. So one job shows on different days: checked in
  Monday, completed Wednesday, collected Friday. A job that is not
  finished shows only on Check-in, and a reopened job leaves its old
  completion day until it is completed again (D100, D101).
- Success looks like: Gross sales and the counts at the top; with View
  costs also Direct costs, Yield, Cult Commons and BICII after Cult
  Commons. Below: the period day by day (or week by week), the
  **Breakdown** by job or sale, product, category, service, mechanic,
  ownership or channel (tap a row for the job, the sale or its lines),
  **Stock at cost now** (stock at this moment, whatever period you chose)
  and **Activity** (jobs, appointments and stock, for everyone).
- Refunds are shown beside gross sales, "Refunds recorded: … — not
  deducted from the figures above", and never change gross, yield or Cult
  Commons (D102, a build default the owner is asked to confirm).
- **Export CSV** downloads the table beside it. On an iPhone or iPad
  app it opens in a new window: use Share → Save to Files. The file is a
  snapshot of the moment you export; costs are in it only if you have
  View costs.
- If it fails: "Too many rows to export" means choose a shorter range;
  "Figures changed while exporting" means try again
  ([R-057](RISKS.md#r-057--csv-exports-stop-at-50000-rows-and-refuse-when-figures-change-mid-export)).
  "Costs, yield and Cult Commons need the View costs permission" and
  "… need the View financial reports permission" mean ask an admin.

### Check what needs attention (Exceptions)

- Steps: **Reports** → **Exceptions** (or **See all** under Needs
  attention on Today). The count on the Exceptions link is how many you
  can see.
- Success looks like: the exceptions grouped by what is wrong, the most
  serious first: Stock below zero, Items in an impossible state, Lines in
  another currency, Unsettled consignments (Manage consignments or View
  costs), then overdue jobs, jobs not collected and stale holds. Each row
  says what is wrong and how long ago it started; tap it to open the
  record and fix it there (adjust stock with a reason, restock, settle,
  void or return). Stock and item rows also link to **Open stock
  reconciliation** for that product.
- Nothing here changes anything: an exception clears by itself once its
  cause is fixed. "No exceptions" with the time checked means all clear.
- **Export CSV** downloads the list you can see (at most 200; with more,
  fix the most urgent first and export again).
- If it fails: an item still listed after the fix, ask an admin (it may
  be a bug to report, [RUNBOOK](RUNBOOK.md#when-reconciliation-or-exceptions-show-a-problem)).

### Check stock against the ledger

- Steps: **Inventory** → **Reconcile stock** (or Reports → **Stock
  reconciliation**, or **Check against the ledger** on a product).
- Success looks like: "Every product reconciles with the ledger" and
  "Every item reconciles with the ledger" under **Problems only**.
  **Everything** lists every product by location and every unique item,
  with what the ledger says (on hand, where, and the sale or job that
  last moved it).
- If a row shows a problem: open it (tap the row). With Adjust stock,
  **Fix with a stock adjustment** opens the product, where Adjust stock
  records a counted correction with a reason. Stock below zero is allowed
  when a job part was used before the stock was received: count the shelf
  and adjust, or receive the delivery. A problem that stays after the
  right fix is a bug: tell an admin.
- **Export CSV** downloads products by location or unique items, as
  shown (Problems only or Everything, one product or all).

### Change when unsettled consignments are flagged (admins)

- Steps: **Reports** → **Exceptions** → **Change** beside "Alert
  unsettled consignments after N days". Enter 1 to 365 days and **Save**.
- Success looks like: a toast "Alert unsettled consignments after N
  days"; a sold consignment item with money still owed shows under
  Unsettled consignments once its latest sale is more than N shop days
  old (D107; 30 by default).
- If it fails: "Choose between 1 and 365 days" — the number stays in the
  box to correct. Only admins see Change; everyone else sees the number.

### Invite a colleague

- Before you start: you need Manage staff (an admin has it; anyone else
  only as extra access). An admin invites an Admin, a Manager or a
  Mechanic; anyone else invites Mechanics only (D93).
- Steps: Settings → **Staff** → **Invite staff**. Enter **Name** and
  **Email**. An admin picks the **Role** (Admin, Manager or Mechanic;
  Mechanic is chosen first, and each role's one line is listed under the
  picker). Anyone else sees "They join as a Mechanic." instead of a picker.
  Press **Invite**.
- Success looks like: "<email> can now sign in." and "They join as a
  Mechanic." (or the role picked). The colleague opens the Admin, enters
  that email and types the 6-digit code emailed to them; there is no
  password to hand over. **Set extra access** (or **Open their page** for
  an admin) opens their page.
- If it fails: "An account with that email already exists."; "Only an
  admin can invite a manager." (or an admin) when you are not an admin.
  Covered by `tests/e2e/staff.spec.ts` and `tests/e2e/roles.spec.ts`.

### Change someone's role

- Before you start: admins only, and never your own role (D93). The shop
  always keeps at least one active admin.
- Steps: Settings → **Staff** → open the person. In the **Role** card pick
  **Admin**, **Manager** or **Mechanic** and press **Change role…**. The
  sheet "Change <name> to <Role>?" says what changes: what the new role
  has (for example "Managers have every permission except Manage staff,
  and can record refunds."), any extra access the new role already
  includes ("Their extra access to … is included in the new role and will
  be removed.") and anything they lose. Optionally answer **Why?** (up to
  500 characters), then press **Change role**.
- Success looks like: "<name> is now a <Role>"; the badge beside their name
  shows the new role, the **Extra access** card offers only what the new
  role does not include, and **History** reads "Role changed from <From>
  to <To>" with your name and the reason, plus "Extra access: … removed"
  for each exception the role now includes. Changing the role back later
  does not restore removed extra access (D92).
- If it fails: on your own row the picker is off with "You can't change
  your own role."; "The shop must keep at least one active admin." when the
  change would leave no active admin; "Someone changed their role in the
  meantime. Reload and try again." when another admin changed it after you
  opened the page (nothing changes; reload to see their current role and
  what a change would do); anyone who is not an admin sees the
  role read-only with "Only an admin changes roles." Covered by
  `tests/e2e/roles.spec.ts`.

### Give someone extra access

- Before you start: you need Manage staff. An admin changes anyone's extra
  access but their own; anyone else changes mechanics' only, only
  permissions they hold themselves, never Manage staff and never their own
  (D11, D93).
- Steps: Settings → **Staff** → open the person → **Extra access**. The
  card first says what the role includes ("Included in the Manager role:
  …"); those are never offered as switches. Turn a switch on or off: it
  applies at once.
- Success looks like: "<Permission> granted" or "<Permission> removed";
  History reads "Extra access: <Permission> granted" (or removed) with your
  name; their profile marks it **Extra access**. An admin's card reads
  "Admins have every permission; there is nothing extra to grant."; a
  manager's offers only **Manage staff**; a mechanic's all seven.
- If it fails: a switch you may not change is off with the reason under it
  (for example "Only an admin changes an admin's or a manager's access.").
  Covered by `tests/e2e/staff.spec.ts` and `tests/e2e/roles.spec.ts`.

## Roles and limits

Everyone has one of three roles (D90, [ADR-021](decisions/ADR-021-staff-roles.md)),
shown as a badge on Settings → Your profile and on Settings → Staff:

| Role | What it lets you do |
|---|---|
| Admin | Everything: every permission below, **Record refund** on a sale, and the admin-only settings: shop hours, closures, booking capacity, appointment types, the Cult Commons rate, staff and roles (inviting or changing admins and managers, changing anyone's role) (D91, D93) |
| Manager | Every permission below except Manage staff, and **Record refund** on a sale (D91, D94). Not the admin-only settings |
| Mechanic | The workshop: what everyone can do (next paragraph). Anything more only as extra access |

Everyone signed in can use customers, bikes, photos, jobs and their lines,
parts from stock, appointments and check-in, in-store sales, Scan, search,
and read the schedule, appointment types, services and locations. Selling
prices and sale totals are visible to all; costs are not.

**Extra access (exceptions).** An admin can give one person a single
permission on top of their role (D92): for example a mechanic who orders
parts gets Manage purchasing alone, or a manager who invites colleagues gets
Manage staff. A mechanic can have any of them; a manager only Manage staff
(their role already includes the rest); an admin none. Your profile marks
each one **Extra access**. Extra access never includes **Record refund**,
which is for admins and managers only. Each permission, whether it comes
from your role or as extra access:

| Permission | What changes for you |
|---|---|
| View costs | Cost, yield and Cult Commons on jobs, lines, products, units, movements and sales (the sale sheet's preview and "Below cost" warning); Unit cost on manual lines and adjustments; the Cult Commons rate card; consignment money (balances, amounts owed, charges, payments, item history, agreement photos) read-only |
| View financial reports | The Money section on Today, and on Reports the figures, date basis, breakdown, line drill-down, stock at cost now and their CSV exports (costs inside them also need View costs) |
| Adjust stock | **Adjust stock** on a product; **Restock…** a unit sold on a sale (a consigned one also needs Manage consignments) |
| Manage inventory | New and edited products and units, **Transfer**, publication, services, categories and locations; with Adjust stock also **Split off as unique item** |
| Manage staff | Settings → Staff: invite (the colleague signs in with an emailed code; no password to hand over), extra access and deactivation (it ends their sessions at once). Without the Admin role: mechanics only, only within your own permissions, never Manage staff and never your own row ([OPERATIONS.md](OPERATIONS.md#product-administration), D93) |
| Manage consignments | **Receive item**, **New consignor**, edit and archive consignors, **Show payout details**, **Edit terms**, **Add charge** and **Void…**, **Return to consignor…**, **Record payment** and **Reverse…**; with Adjust stock, **Restock…** a consigned unit; sees consignment money |
| Manage purchasing | **Purchasing**: new and edited suppliers and their product links, **New order**, lines, **Submit order**, **Cancel order…**, **Receive**, **Reorder**; sees purchase costs on purchasing screens (line, receipt and last costs, order totals and history). A mechanic given it as extra access sees those costs on purchasing screens only, not job, sale, product-page or report costs (D60); a manager sees them everywhere through View costs |

Without a permission, its buttons are absent and the figures are not sent
to your screen at all. Opening a page you may not use shows "You can't open
this"; an action you may not take says "You don't have permission to do
that." Ask an admin.

Everyone can open Consignment, its consignors and items, and the asking
prices; who is owed what, payments and agreement photos need Manage
consignments or View costs (D48). Anyone may record an in-store sale and
see its total; its cost, yield and Cult Commons need View costs, and an
admin or a manager records a refund (D48, D94).

Everyone can open Purchasing, its orders and suppliers, and see what is
ordered, received and still to come; costs on those screens need View
costs or Manage purchasing (D60).

Everyone can open Reports and see Activity and jobs by mechanic, and
export that list; sales, yield and Cult Commons figures need View
financial reports, and costs inside them View costs (D30).

Everyone can open Exceptions and Stock reconciliation and export them;
unsettled consignments are listed only with Manage consignments or View
costs, Shopify failures (when Phase 10 arrives) only for admins (D108),
and only an admin changes the unsettled-consignment threshold (D107).

Not available yet: **Labels** shows "Phase 8 (QR and labels)"
([R-018](RISKS.md#r-018--four-sections-are-placeholder-pages)).
There is no reschedule and no customer messaging; the only data exports
are the report CSVs. Help: ask the owner or an admin.
