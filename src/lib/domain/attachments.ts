/**
 * Photos (SPEC §8; DATA-MODEL §2 "Attachment storage"; ADR-001 A7).
 *
 * Every Storage call here uses the signed-in staff member's RLS client:
 * the storage.objects policies (active staff only on media-internal) are
 * what allow minting an upload URL, signing a download URL, copying and
 * removing. Rows change only through the attachment RPCs.
 *
 * Upload: the server picks the attachment id and mints a signed upload URL
 * for exactly `{entity_type}/{entity_id}/{id}.{ext}` in media-internal; the
 * phone uploads to it directly; the server then calls record_attachment,
 * which checks the object really is there. New photos are internal.
 *
 * Storage and Postgres do not share a transaction, so the multi-step
 * changes below are ordered so that a failure at any step leaves the row
 * pointing at an object that exists, and are safe to repeat:
 *
 *   visibility to/from public = copy to the other bucket, then the RPC
 *   (which checks the copy exists), then remove the original. If the RPC
 *   fails the copy is removed again (a private photo must not linger in
 *   the public bucket). If removing the original fails, the change has
 *   still happened: the result says the cleanup is pending, and choosing
 *   the same setting again (the viewer's "Finish") removes it. An object
 *   is only removed after re-reading the row and seeing it names the
 *   other bucket (Storage's own policy refuses to delete an object a row
 *   points at, too).
 *
 *   delete = the RPC (reason required; the row is kept in
 *   attachment_events), then remove the object. A replay finds the path in
 *   the `deleted` event and removes whatever is left.
 *
 * Whatever a failed cleanup (or a crash between steps) leaves behind is
 * not left for staff to remember: listPhotos removes the record's stray
 * objects (attachment_stray_objects: nothing points at them, and they are
 * old enough not to belong to a change still running) every time the
 * record is shown, so media-public ends up holding only public photos.
