# Current state

Updated: 2026-10-06 21:10 SGT by the go-live session (GO-LIVE, see
`HANDOVER.md` on `handover/go-live`), on a local branch from
`claude/brave-clarke-kfqhgt` 1b4aaed (Shopify merged with `main` 680cb9f,
PR #17): reporting joins. The build session paused for the handover with
Phase 9 complete on `feat/p9-reporting` (ba1c26c, branched from
`feat/staff-roles` 5c9fbc7, auto-saved to `wip/feat/p9-reporting`); this
merge brings it onto labels, Shopify, the migrate workflow and the public
site's backend. Evidence checked: `git fetch`, `git log`, `git merge-base`
(5c9fbc7), the build session's status (idle, "work paused for handoff"),
the hosted project's migration history (read-only); the gate on this
merge is in the last rows below. Earlier rows keep the evidence of their
own phase.

## Return in two minutes

- Purpose: the staff Admin for BICII's workshop, over one Supabase backend
  shared with the public site ([PRODUCT.md](docs/PRODUCT.md)).
- On `main`: phases 0–8 (labels in PR #16, which also closed #12), staff
  email sign-in, staff roles (PRs #1–#11, #13), the hosted migration
  workflow (PR #14, `migrate.yml`), the public site's backend (PR #15,
  Phase 11 step 1) and Phase 10, Shopify (PR #17; built against an
  in-memory fake; no store connected). This branch adds Phase 9,
  reporting and reconciliation.
- Go-live state (2026-10-06): the Vercel project is linked to this
  repository and deploys `main` to production (functions in sin1); the
  sign-in page answers 200. The hosted database still has only
  `20261004000100_foundation`: `migrate.yml` stops at its first step
  because the `SUPABASE_DB_URL` Actions secret is not set (owner). The
  Vercel project lacks `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` (owner; without it
  nobody can sign in). The owner's Auth login (george@chaosactive.com,
  confirmed, no known password) exists on the hosted project; its admin
  staff row waits for the loaded database.
- Current objective: merge the build session's work in order (labels and
  Shopify merged; reporting on this branch; then Shopify's refund-roles
  follow-up after review) and Phase 11
  ([PLAN Phase 11](docs/PLAN.md#phase-11--public-site-integration-in-the-bicii-repo),
  D120–D125, [ADR-023](docs/decisions/ADR-023-public-site.md)). Step 1
  (this repository) is on `main`; step 2, the screens in repository
  `bicii`, merges only after the Admin is live on the same database.
- Next action: the owner sets `SUPABASE_DB_URL` (Actions secret) and
  `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` (Vercel, production); then dispatch
  `migrate.yml`, run the advisors, give the owner's login its admin staff
  row and sign in. An admin sets the QR address before the first print
  ([RUNBOOK](docs/RUNBOOK.md#labels-the-qr-address-before-the-first-print)).
  `vercel.json`'s 5-minute cron needs a Vercel plan that allows it
  ([R-049](docs/RISKS.md#r-049--queued-integration-jobs-wait-for-a-trigger),
  [RUNBOOK](docs/RUNBOOK.md#shopify-the-cron-and-the-queue)); Shopify stays
  off until the owner connects a store
  ([RUNBOOK](docs/RUNBOOK.md#shopify)). While the hosted database holds
  only the foundation no migration needs renaming; once it is loaded,
  later ones are renamed past everything live (`HANDOVER.md` "Migrations
  after go-live"). The build session's unreviewed Shopify follow-up
  (`wip/feat/p10-shopify` 8dbe6c4: managers retry and dismiss Shopify
  refund jobs and read refund events, D94 over D86) is not proposed yet:
  it widens who reads Shopify refund events (payloads with payment and
  line details), which is the owner's call, and it no longer fits as
  written: with reporting on `main`, `private.exception_visible`
  keeps `integration_failed` admin-only (D108), so managers would still
  not see refund jobs on Today. A cherry-pick onto this merge conflicted
  in DATA-MODEL and PLAN and was dropped; it needs a design pass against
  D108 and the owner's decision.
- Phase 9 reporting, step 1 of 4 (database), committed locally on
  `feat/p9-reporting`, not pushed: `20261006001000_report_periods` and
  `20261006001100_report_stock_value` (D100–D105,
  [ADR-022](docs/decisions/ADR-022-reporting.md)): four date bases over
  `reporting.report_lines`, the summary, series, breakdown, line-item,
  activity and by-mechanic RPCs, stock value at last cost; refunds beside
  gross (D102, the build default for owner question 12); risks R-055 and
  R-056; owner question 26.
- Phase 9 reporting, step 2 of 4 (app), committed locally on
  `feat/p9-reporting`, not pushed: `/reports` (period and date-basis
  controls in the URL, figures with cost tiles hidden without View costs,
  refunds beside gross, buckets, the breakdown by seven dimensions, stock
  at last cost now, activity and jobs by mechanic), `/reports/lines` (one
  group's lines; View financial reports, a real 403) and the app's first
  Route Handler, the CSV export `/reports/export` (R-057: 50,000 rows at
  most, 409 when the counts move); `ComingSoon` placeholders at
  `/reports/exceptions` and `/reports/reconciliation`.
- Phase 9 reporting, step 3 of 4 (database), committed locally on
  `feat/p9-reporting`, not pushed: `20261006001200_stock_reconciliation`
  (no balance cache, D106: `reporting.unit_ledger_disposition`,
  `unit_reconciliation`, `stock_reconciliation`, the RPCs
  `report_stock_reconciliation` and `report_unit_reconciliation`) and
  `20261006001300_operational_exceptions` (the threshold
  `shop_settings.consignment_settlement_alert_days` and its admin RPC,
  D107; `private.exception_visible`, D108; the exceptions view and
  `public.operational_exceptions` with six appended columns and the kinds
  unit_state_mismatch, unsettled_consignment and integration_failed;
  `report_exception_counts`; Today's `exceptions_now` per caller; the
  Phase 10 placeholder `private.integration_exceptions()`, R-058). The seed
  reconciles unchanged; no RPC defect was found. Risks R-058 (re-verify at
  the Phase 10 merge) and R-059 (Today slow at a busy year's volume, mostly
  Phase 5's `daily_summary`); owner question 27.
- Phase 9 reporting, step 4 of 4 (app and closure), committed locally on
  `feat/p9-reporting`, not pushed: `/reports/exceptions` (grouped,
  per-caller exceptions, the admin's threshold sheet, Export CSV) and
  `/reports/reconciliation` (Problems only / Everything, a product
  filter, links to the guarded fix); Today's "See all exceptions",
  Inventory's "Reconcile stock", the product page's "Check against the
  ledger", the Exceptions count on `/reports`; export kinds `exceptions`,
  `stock` and `units` for any staff; Phase 5's `ExceptionList` and
  helpers extended, not rewritten. The integration review fixed Today's
  Activity and Stock grids widening the phone page. No new decision,
  risk number or owner question; R-018, R-021, R-055–R-059 updated.
- Phase 10 step 4 in one line: every staff member sees a product's
  Shopify status on its page; manage_inventory switches **Publish online**
  and runs **Sync now** (the action runs only the job id the RPC returned);
  admins get **More → Shopify** (connection, settings, tiles), the queue
  (Retry, Link to a BICII product then retry, Dismiss with a reason), the
  products and events lists and the event inspector (outcome in words,
  delivery evidence, the customer link, never by email; JsonView), all real
  403s for anyone else; Today's Needs attention shows "Shopify needs
  attention" rows that open the queue on that job.
- Phase 10 step 3 in one line: every Shopify call is in
  `src/lib/integrations/shopify/` behind the `ShopifyAdmin` interface (the
  GraphQL adapter pinned to 2026-10, or the in-memory fake with
  `SHOPIFY_ADAPTER=fake`, never in production); `POST
  /api/shopify/webhooks` checks the HMAC on the raw bytes, stores every
  delivery (rejected ones as body-less evidence; 413/503/401/400/500/200),
  then runs the event's job and up to 5 due jobs in `after()`; `GET
  /api/cron/integrations` (Vercel cron every 5 minutes, bearer
  `CRON_SECRET`) runs up to 25; `runProductSync` pushes only when the
  desired-state hash changed, at `product_sync_state.sale_price` exactly,
  defers while an order is in flight and once when Shopify's count moved,
  then overwrites (D83). Nothing verified against a real store
  ([R-047](docs/RISKS.md#r-047--the-live-shopify-adapter-is-unverified-against-a-real-store);
  RUNBOOK "Shopify: verify before go-live"). No screens yet.
- Phase 10 step 2 in one line: the online price is
  `private.shopify_online_price` (through `private.selling_price`, so a
  consigned item sells online at its asking price; 0 is a price); staff
  with manage_inventory publish a public, priced, unarchived, shop-saleable
  product online and get back the one sync job to run; every stock,
  product, unit, asking-price or public-photo change queues one sync per
  product (deferred triggers, run at commit); the worker's state and
  result RPCs are service-role only; `reporting.shopify_sync_status` shows
  every staff member the status (the open job to admins only); and
  `reporting.public_items.buy_online_url` is the storefront's
  `/products/<handle>` only for an available, published, synced,
  BICII-created listing (D84; the rule Phase 11 reads).
- Phase 10 step 1 in one line: every webhook is stored before processing
  (deduplicated on its webhook id; rejected deliveries kept as body-less
  evidence, D88); a paid order becomes one online sale through Phase 6's
  `private.sell_line` at Shopify's discounted prices split exactly (D80),
  or nothing, waiting for an admin with a human message (D82); a refund is
  one `sale_refunds` row and never moves stock (D85); test and POS orders
  are skipped and tax-exclusive orders refused (D89); retries back off and
  admins dismiss with a reason (D87); only admins see payloads, the queue
  and the `integration_failed` exceptions, and link variants and customers
  (never by email, D86). No screen, route or Shopify API call yet.
- Phase 8 in one line: labels encode only
  `{shop_settings.public_site_url}/q/{short_id}` (no fallback: nothing
  prints until an admin sets the address; the environment's address is
  only an extra scan base), print 1–500 per job for a product and 1–10
  for a unit or bike, label unique items per unit, price through
  `private.selling_price` (NULL no price line, 0 → $0.00), never carry
  cost, consignor, ownership or notes, render from the job's snapshot only
  while the job is open, and are confirmed printed or failed by staff. The
  anonymous half of SPEC §31 is proven at the database (`labels.test.ts`:
  anon and staff read identical `reporting.public_items` rows) and shown
  to staff in "What the public sees" until Phase 11. New stock from a
  purchase order is labelled from the order's receipts ("Print N labels",
  [R-029](docs/RISKS.md#r-029--the-purchase-receive-screen-has-no-print-n-labels-shortcut-yet),
  resolved at the merge); untested on a real printer and iOS
  ([R-075](docs/RISKS.md#r-075--label-output-is-unverified-on-a-real-label-printer-and-on-ios));
  print success is confirmed by hand
  ([R-076](docs/RISKS.md#r-076--print-success-is-confirmed-by-hand)).
- Owner questions: 12 (refund netting; D102 is the build default), 18
  (D70–D72), 19 (SMTP provider), 20 (D92, D93), 21 (the label defaults
  D56–D59), 23–25 (Shopify: D89's tax basis and POS, the defaults
  D80–D88), 26–27 (the reporting defaults D100–D108) and 30 (the
  public-site defaults D120–D125) in
  [PRODUCT.md](docs/PRODUCT.md#open-assumptions-and-owner-questions); the
  Supabase dashboard checklist in `HANDOVER.md` (SMTP, templates, Auth
  settings, rate limits, site URL).
- Main uncertainty: hosted email delivery and Auth settings are unverified
  ([R-039](docs/RISKS.md#r-039--hosted-email-delivery-and-auth-settings-are-unverified)).

## What is actually working

CI runs `check`, `test (unit + db)` and `build` in one run per head; e2e is
a separate, label-triggered run. All listed results are success.

## Work location and continuation

- `main` on origin holds PRs #1–#11 and #13–#16 (through labels) and
  Shopify (PR #17, merged before this branch is pushed). The local `main`
  ref is stale; use `origin/main`.
- `claude/brave-clarke-kfqhgt`: the go-live session's branch, restarted
  from `main` after each merge (PRs #14–#17); this merge is pushed there
  once PR #17 has merged.
- The build session's branches, paused for the handover: `feat/p8-labels`
  (3f09d22) and `wip/feat/p8-labels` (01cb3da), both merged through PR
  #16; `wip/feat/p10-shopify` (8dbe6c4: 3b5341c, merged through PR #17,
  plus the unreviewed refund-roles follow-up); `wip/feat/p9-reporting`
  (ba1c26c, merged here). No `feat/p9-reporting` or `feat/p10-shopify`
  exists on origin.
- One devstack on this container serves `bicii_dev`; the build session's
  second worktree (`.wt-env`, `bicii_dev_wt`) is not used.
- Local-only artifacts (git-ignored): `.env.local`, `.devstack/` (with
  `.devstack/mail/`, the mail catcher's codes), `test-results/`.
