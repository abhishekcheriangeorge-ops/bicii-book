# Current state

Updated: 2026-10-05 16:10 SGT. Evidence checked: GitHub REST pull list and
check runs for the seven PR heads, `git ls-remote --heads origin`, local
refs and worktrees, all on 2026-10-05; local gates on application code
b34bbcd (the head of PR #7; the docs commits on top change no code).

## Return in two minutes

- Purpose: the staff Admin for BICII's workshop, over one Supabase backend
  shared with the public site ([PRODUCT.md](docs/PRODUCT.md)).
- Current objective: land the docs retrofit, then continue the main line.
- Next action: the orchestrator pushes `feat/docs-stack` and opens its PR on
  top of PR #7; then [PLAN](docs/PLAN.md#2-phases) Phase 6, consignment and
  sales, which also implements the D27 change
  ([R-007](docs/RISKS.md#r-007--consigned-stock-cannot-be-a-job-part-yet)).
- Main uncertainty: nothing hosted exists
  ([R-001](docs/RISKS.md#r-001--nothing-is-deployed)).

## What is actually working

CI runs `check`, `test (unit + db)` and `build` in one run per head; e2e is
a separate, label-triggered run. All listed results are success.

## Work location and continuation

- PR stack: `main` (1594c78) ← `docs/build-plan` (#1) ← `feat/m1.1-foundation`
  (#2) ← … ← `feat/p2-appointments` (#7) ← `feat/docs-stack`. #1–#7 are open
  drafts, pushed and equal to origin.
- `feat/docs-stack`: local only, not pushed.
- Parallel track: a second worktree of this clone (`bicii-book-wt`, see
  `git worktree list`) with its own database builds purchasing and email
  OTP. `feat/p7-purchasing` is local
  only and forks from PR #6 (no appointments); it is merged in a later
  integration step
  ([R-009](docs/RISKS.md#r-009--the-seven-pr-stack-is-unmerged-and-the-purchasing-track-forks-from-pr-6)).
- Local-only artifacts (git-ignored): `.env.local`, `.devstack/`,
  `test-results/`.

## Attention and links

- Main risk: [R-001](docs/RISKS.md#r-001--nothing-is-deployed), then the PR
  stack integration ([R-009](docs/RISKS.md#r-009--the-seven-pr-stack-is-unmerged-and-the-purchasing-track-forks-from-pr-6)).
- Decisions needed: [owner questions](docs/PRODUCT.md#open-assumptions-and-owner-questions).
- Running costs, backups, recovery: none yet ([OPERATIONS.md](docs/OPERATIONS.md)).
