# Current state

Updated: 2026-10-05, Phase 6 step 3 checkpoint on `feat/p6-consignment`.
Evidence checked: local refs and `git worktree list` on 2026-10-05; local
gates on this branch at ecc90f1 plus the step 3 docs (below); step 2's at
2c402b2, step 1's at 365bdd7. Earlier rows: GitHub REST pull list and check
runs for the seven PR heads, local gates on b34bbcd (the head of PR #7).

## Return in two minutes

- Purpose: the staff Admin for BICII's workshop, over one Supabase backend
  shared with the public site ([PRODUCT.md](docs/PRODUCT.md)).
- Current objective: [PLAN](docs/PLAN.md#2-phases) Phase 6, consignment and
  sales, in four steps on `feat/p6-consignment`. Steps 1 and 2 (the whole
  Phase 6 database: consignment core, consigned job parts, sales,
  restocks, refunds, settlements, the ledgers, reporting, read RPCs,
  search and the seed) and step 3 (the consignment domain module and
  screens, consigned stock in the job part picker, the Phase 4 touch
  points and `tests/e2e/consignment.spec.ts`) are built and committed
  locally.
- Next action: Phase 6 step 4, the sales screens over
  [DATA-MODEL §16](docs/DATA-MODEL.md#16-rpc-catalogue-security-definer-in-public)
  (`saleable_stock`, `record_retail_sale` with a client sale id and D53's
  warnings, `list_sales`, `sale_lines_detail`, `restock_unit`,
  `record_sale_refund` for admins only), "Sell" on the consignment item
  page, `S-` resolution and the `sale` search kind, Today, Sales
  navigation, journey 4 and the closing Phase 6 docs.
- Main uncertainty: nothing hosted exists
  ([R-001](docs/RISKS.md#r-001--nothing-is-deployed)).

## What is actually working

CI runs `check`, `test (unit + db)` and `build` in one run per head; e2e is
a separate, label-triggered run. All listed results are success.

## Work location and continuation

- PR stack: `main` (1594c78) ← `docs/build-plan` (#1) ← `feat/m1.1-foundation`
  (#2) ← … ← `feat/p2-appointments` (#7) ← `feat/docs-stack`. #1–#7 are open
  drafts, pushed and equal to origin.
- `feat/docs-stack` (6507449): pushed, equal to `origin/feat/docs-stack`.
- `feat/p6-consignment`: stacked on `feat/docs-stack`; local only, not
  pushed (34783d6 decisions D44–D53, step 1's commits, step 2's 2d2ba0c and
  2c402b2, step 3's 2137316, 5627bb0, ecc90f1 and its docs commit with
  this checkpoint). The orchestrator pushes.
- Parallel track: a second worktree of this clone (`bicii-book-wt`, see
  `git worktree list`) with its own database builds purchasing and email
  OTP. `feat/p7-purchasing` is local
  only and forks from PR #6 (no appointments); it is merged in a later
  integration step
  ([R-009](docs/RISKS.md#r-009--the-seven-pr-stack-is-unmerged-and-the-purchasing-track-forks-from-pr-6)).
- Local-only artifacts (git-ignored): `.env.local`, `.devstack/`,
  `test-results/`.
