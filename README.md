# BICII Admin (bicii-book)

The phone-first staff app for BICII, a custom bicycle workshop in
Singapore. Built so far (not deployed; see [NOW.md](NOW.md)): staff
sign-in with emailed one-time codes, intake, work orders, appointments,
inventory, consignment and in-store sales, and purchasing. Labels, staff
roles, reporting, the Shopify boundary and the public site's integration
are planned or on other branches.

Owner: Abhishek Cherian George (George), GitHub
[abhishekcheriangeorge-ops](https://github.com/abhishekcheriangeorge-ops).
Application: not deployed.

It shares one Supabase backend with the public site
(`abhishekcheriangeorge-ops/bicii`), which stays the customer-facing
client: business rules live in Postgres
(RLS, constraints, RPCs), and this app and the public site are two
frontends over the same database.

No issue tracker is in use: the backlog is the phases in
[PLAN §2](docs/PLAN.md#2-phases) plus the next actions in
[RISKS](docs/RISKS.md), and [NOW](NOW.md) names the next action.

## Quickstart

Node 22, a local Postgres 16 superuser, curl, tar and git; no Docker.
Set up the devstack, reset the database and run `npm run dev`, then open
http://localhost:3000 with a seeded login: every step is in
[ENGINEERING.md](docs/ENGINEERING.md#clean-checkout-to-running-application).

## Stack

Next.js 16 (App Router, Turbopack; `proxy.ts` and async request APIs, see
[AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md)), React 19, TypeScript 5, Tailwind 4, Supabase
(Postgres, Auth, Storage, RLS), zod, decimal.js, pino and `@zxing/browser`
for the QR scanner, tested with Vitest and Playwright on GitHub Actions;
Vercel is planned for hosting. Installed versions and how the parts fit:
[ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md#current-system).
