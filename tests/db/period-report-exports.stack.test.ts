/**
 * The period-report reads and export pagers of the app (Phase 9 step 2;
 * src/lib/domain/period-reports.ts, src/lib/domain/report-exports.ts)
 * against the devstack's seeded database, through PostgREST as the app
 * calls it:
 *
 *   * the breakdown keyset: walking report_breakdown two groups at a time
 *     with the cursor passed back as received (sale_total never rounded)
 *     visits every group exactly once, in the same order as one page;
 *   * the export pagers' consistency check: the groups' line counts add
 *     up to report_period_summary's, the lines of one group number its
 *     line_count, and the breakdown export ends with the summary's own
 *     TOTAL row (never a sum made in TypeScript);
 *   * a caller without view_financial_reports (view_costs alone included)
 *     is refused by the database (42501); the by-mechanic activity is
 *     for every active staff member, its lead-less row "Unassigned".
 *
 * Needs the devstack (`npm run db:reset && npm run devstack:start`); skips
 * otherwise, unless BICII_REQUIRE_STACK=1. Read-only.
