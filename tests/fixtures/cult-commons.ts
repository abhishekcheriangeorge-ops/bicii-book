/**
 * Cult Commons fixtures (SPEC §10; PLAN D1; TESTING.md "Cult Commons
 * formula"). Run through src/lib/cult-commons.ts (tests/unit) AND through
 * the database's generated columns and work_order_totals_staff
 * (tests/db/work-order-lines.test.ts), so the preview and the stored
 * figures can never disagree. Every value was worked out by hand:
 * sale = round(q × price, 2), cost = round(q × cost, 2), yield = sale − cost,
 * cc = round(max(yield, 0) × rate, 2), afterCc = yield − cc. The shared
 * fixture table: later phases (Phase 5) add cases here, not a new table.
